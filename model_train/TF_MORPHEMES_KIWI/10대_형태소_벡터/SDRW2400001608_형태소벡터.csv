SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30915851016949747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3509054673689815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2735663004607833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44793585987761875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41653132479981025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44793585987761875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36284491748465386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3548598939172832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850506234179415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4108000585080189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46674022309875457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4340173245290047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46674022309875457
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34356368096214884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422914191536992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30238658091959436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30238658091959436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28913051554990843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2782995215062565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34356368096214884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26120948087703993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30238658091959436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28913051554990843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34356368096214884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23609127725571338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.260073592327929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3010716307366297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34206966914533044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34206966914533044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2770893156644141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.260073592327929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3010716307366297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878732103375977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34206966914533044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34206966914533044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3567216953200766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2705381238320427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2705381238320427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28384894021242707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836168610055837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836168610055837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33763927158344115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3005190384591308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836168610055837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45814050349084134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718701743168383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45814050349084134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3389910861670135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42602052650044403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45814050349084134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995509105191034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22233313007253716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995509105191034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32213566349418365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32213566349418365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32213566349418365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32213566349418365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32213566349418365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28352677327090053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26094202029582025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32213566349418365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30864458258802746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34027178399694885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.512820187672897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.512820187672897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.512820187672897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6185474396055307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6185474396055307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4845597279127566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.542212264895504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32176011911336116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5041980632703404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45630583316515433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3742266494504844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2406744310501261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2653366449175247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.323922876996243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998861922807034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2373008454259598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3718503927891385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998861922807034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3040311606949124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998861922807034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3792393031730277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32522918010758867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.419042905608939,0.4506368022615556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35302134049829736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674173207802416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.419042905608939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3282310724231872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5453635983133712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5453635983133712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5453635983133712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5530139141578537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4332218591789675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5530139141578537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4479620990944866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4042369371067892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37589610930482575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4042369371067892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3166724615037925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2991063163691586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34019088892832794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37589610930482575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29174192379462427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41080213645616726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3123304899586183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41080213645616726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820010261634993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34571591842870386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615663132073928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41080213645616726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3334013878319894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3017326109234263,0.0,0.29042953519836306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21896884773677822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35853831020917654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29042953519836306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35853831020917654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3334013878319894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29042953519836306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35853831020917654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37901435655829113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35244186991080584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3335883905951293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2969135133855494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37901435655829113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3189644959141904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37901435655829113,0.37901435655829113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25118152207024796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35616964320716055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35616964320716055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35616964320716055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33119878676176284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35616964320716055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28851082571363923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35616964320716055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33119878676176284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4939307750175603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40010253109305166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45930156191038446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3755327133828947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4939307750175603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886942738723907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44162421194218676,0.0,0.0,0.3886942738723907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44162421194218676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357643358025947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44162421194218676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.434219047940604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3301342324131858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3301342324131858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2651890798990032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.434219047940604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3821766401768949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.434219047940604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45445294840233397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48871659847996934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45445294840233397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3305407813223479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48871659847996934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35638082380598024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2709542804995964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35638082380598024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3136675521527883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35638082380598024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331395161605747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35638082380598024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35638082380598024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886818899525551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3659965014908303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3874910247158808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3874910247158808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4946378483423728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40067528711724515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40067528711724515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886822076050004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.240613971828771,0.27337926703300564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19730060756101514,0.0,0.27337926703300564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27337926703300564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141607494729618,0.0,0.5467585340660113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20228103378969903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15792871937238726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27337926703300564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18489856248687261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22144750280923503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27337926703300564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40247077459824687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35059662096067196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32025218632604263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33906020232843276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4328152092328762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35059662096067196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4328152092328762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28854192350918256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40914583644346136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40914583644346136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40914583644346136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40914583644346136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28238622661617707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40914583644346136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3540623200706452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43709365116797266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33231977663207884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43709365116797266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43709365116797266,0.43709365116797266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5473021771420261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6503400383729302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5267999253841006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35968912594352637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35968912594352637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35968912594352637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35968912594352637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35968912594352637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344715205125035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35968912594352637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344715205125035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33957603344765247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4477525630240451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29407154971403854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48151103503914594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48151103503914594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36609005686197205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3133938492200501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38330158548161525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4122007519306748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38330158548161525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3133938492200501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4122007519306748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4122007519306748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3229417626561025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5365752865125546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37840899622405905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5365752865125546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42034411298031676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37754216852389844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28704312857849584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37754216852389844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35107289616423515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37754216852389844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3177255567918177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35107289616423515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37754216852389844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5057294433844177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49218246797157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48006428552579283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5210877374090775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5856763554590431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6298336434087463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.510188973113568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3999919892688743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719487724090571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3999919892688743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3999919892688743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719487724090571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3240085765413821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719487724090571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38461744010174626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5453787176828184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5071425178062565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5453787176828184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21749034964219674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25484565458374636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36136529915844307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36136529915844307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830875367441443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36136529915844307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36136529915844307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.304111700500259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36136529915844307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24940882729349237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4113889330320776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4587555900937287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48569774021189993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6200001286205812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4774024296669706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36296630794477264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28330060491024905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4774024296669706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32288850552264464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4774024296669706,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171165514058921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19085891701060886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2948836855998348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171165514058921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24110188113677883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171165514058921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171165514058921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27910921627133545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2668735872797221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2568763504652781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171165514058921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171165514058921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4919487855191991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5290394482652678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44522007679859527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5290394482652678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39133848909129426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3639019643367863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297532391364744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39133848909129426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34443544022801914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169989154735111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39133848909129426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169989154735111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898733841293161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5528315258893585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48657306986026466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5528315258893585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23139522739573248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3117603347443201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28214717520062865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2715777810700263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33526562182699704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33526562182699704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33526562182699704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28214717520062865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28214717520062865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29508306815270324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33526562182699704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3206947048386157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.339528709407583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3295216004803559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2571965130198325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4334132652361964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38146743285827617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4334132652361964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.293136676290961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39157693636637514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37062997092169686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3191664001259124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2406349575436033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940142716495162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940142716495162,0.0,0.3663901492616478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940142716495162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29154227773804403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940142716495162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.377774527730763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2664179350613294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2664179350613294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307169155598747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.377774527730763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.377774527730763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.377774527730763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33249715883561426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3512889647957825,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112487832387272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619354901253647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521232372472033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112487832387272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619354901253647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2894273034094133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112487832387272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521232372472033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619354901253647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366406509143071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366406509143071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112487832387272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2894273034094133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4711924366718802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4147186614177647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43815739587406827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43815739587406827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4711924366718802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43801211220001024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43801211220001024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40730332557629945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40730332557629945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38551509472307416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36861482989945554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118577630294588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200662485543854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200662485543854,0.35200662485543854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200662485543854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29623578556503194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200662485543854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200662485543854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200662485543854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.445841686001847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6719235265475851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5913915500705833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2272682550504956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663029753721646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663029753721646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37761151752549166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37761151752549166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37761151752549166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37761151752549166,0.0,0.37761151752549166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30587955149477397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47301416053633333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086772401474593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086772401474593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086772401474593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34298606420041927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4969481755796517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4969481755796517,0.41821324595355286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4621074141900457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22787293675914352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378616210317152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378616210317152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378616210317152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378616210317152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378616210317152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378616210317152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2966016122734877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970944380458594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4081136885536641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4081136885536641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3019748341573963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34345341988432054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970944380458594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3305874588564302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37950106385463017,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3443962117314689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4529775481908377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42121954313737886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986868799611533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4529775481908377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3669288749076945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3389182051276589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3389182051276589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36447107000896134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36447107000896134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207881589679968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36447107000896134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696824292053919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515523830457298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36447107000896134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36108561281701573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36108561281701573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36108561281701573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30387632679643006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357701004646399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36108561281701573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3178084586042821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24421826669283264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357701004646399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44651451557725086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41520963016122825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41520963016122825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44651451557725086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3394824053909425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757701388220704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21789136785990973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25027326030596975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.22861189754856326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719346230633763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089649672832226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44465808674984214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47818324956845615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35382127954841164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3172891226191411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44465808674984214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38734644236702565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4703158260787373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4373422439641606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4703158260787373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4703158260787373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3809735330229874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30316910372259664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21380395092633697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23749760973072853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23049771727780952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30316910372259664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17990689853552685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2668334105002031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24557839252739497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21880023678231272,0.0,0.25513593000470625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30316910372259664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25513593000470625,0.0,0.22432337455458687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20116191650833495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25513593000470625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2668334105002031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38562892852117087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35859269789639003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31237395636774523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38562892852117087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28533772574296445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38562892852117087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31237395636774523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38562892852117087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24278704692264855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35504813423857856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23938384830425669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4033963529293799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4033963529293799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32676623932779403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4033963529293799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4033963529293799,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40413719330338277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31659432387497877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40413719330338277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29903251311448553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35570018275277115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29903251311448553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37580335848423996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35570018275277115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16901783453559086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20633690926280182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1511592001919961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44839108721279314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23686644632129392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547250806648887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3695833908197682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786467608233536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45625457595210944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45625457595210944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40157114647481523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45625457595210944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17982831554315615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29878894925829663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17730762309781667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5975778985165933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29878894925829663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26297823020684347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5259564604136869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23406626991823068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44578025326197734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39235220162928447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39235220162928447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375152210753628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39235220162928447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44578025326197734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986829871278658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928518450167771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23312651636691156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928518450167771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928518450167771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457674160723214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457674160723214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928518450167771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31746123566477974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4277176422914525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4277176422914525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37258943897811614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4599655739618861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4277176422914525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495614358649505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3362357886987475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36158641178977036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3362357886987475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36158641178977036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36158641178977036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27491205895597337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36158641178977036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3362357886987475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22738010219543395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28377683333642517,0.0,0.0,0.29981510327750927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32241977516445686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32241977516445686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28377683333642517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32241977516445686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2713365846928837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32241977516445686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32241977516445686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32241977516445686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42789157893783714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5218265346115459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5218265346115459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5218265346115459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4041519949274078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401194047247366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3557132103593809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4041519949274078,0.3557132103593809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4041519949274078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3758171223746014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4262444556588255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4262444556588255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3963606929185167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3963606929185167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3751578258261998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4262444556588255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39134574008283457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42085139857776055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42085139857776055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42085139857776055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2792476966273572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2904652273711627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39134574008283457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34440154629010716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34440154629010716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34440154629010716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34440154629010716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34440154629010716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34440154629010716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3031240256666144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34440154629010716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2789782239791269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344300676005571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344300676005571,0.0,0.28144400359767013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3109833607619821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28144400359767013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344300676005571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27090095067643066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29434765751500575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24136159351211878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344300676005571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28144400359767013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.274614575543501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4496522993651379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4496522993651379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784107818659894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4496522993651379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41812742566539046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3868992494613624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29415726313240026,0.23628962493673994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3868992494613624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3597739573389439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3868992494613624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3868992494613624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3597739573389439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298810552817448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3210024234548583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38143595459015006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357197531045912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2822352260156616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3210024234548583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27528622196929947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38143595459015006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38143595459015006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707419273215054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44984404007913414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35240030385208854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37857214377518306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37857214377518306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959289318522953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959289318522953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3749964171332565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28510760851034045,0.22902024979473948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3487056259938033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33005201282179847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3487056259938033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3749964171332565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3749964171332565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30376122168234526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44831223728028574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44831223728028574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44831223728028574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40572843065569325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4821129061453371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41201368748943235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41201368748943235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35890955502926714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3728777689582457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44307761361195813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44307761361195813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5192981308350184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43702214352795477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5192981308350184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5192981308350184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2810023675213619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30218864615721985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085660024219273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26597046360750254,0.26597046360750254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17932507447243223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30218864615721985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30218864615721985,0.30218864615721985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30218864615721985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30218864615721985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543108130989893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30218864615721985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5145773598010905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47850062606842053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4168270423973413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38075030866467136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43304931683390435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31315496188182906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4388643551885617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39717797395312804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4719526974483976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4719526974483976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3257345657779799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49233367574225845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37431844803493247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49233367574225845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36429157916574134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49233367574225845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518935530632632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3571792868411527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3571792868411527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3571792868411527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3571792868411527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3571792868411527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3571792868411527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465197053287579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3321376448396969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41847722297758627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3683215184286619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32782806349182086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32782806349182086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35217498801549324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41847722297758627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41847722297758627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4389041025135097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4389041025135097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36936549603065244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36936549603065244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4389041025135097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38630017741970013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37709926226471074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26026816906247807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37709926226471074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27902638499293764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22377860369358837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37709926226471074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37709926226471074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30546460544004217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37709926226471074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177781263463712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177781263463712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177781263463712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3884879332656692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3884879332656692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177781263463712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.459968348688784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.459968348688784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3870923882890871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.305202982161646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34971127694403625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.459968348688784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44809241185007603,0.44809241185007603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.416676901000174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.416676901000174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39438724132859443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30926655995721086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401225,10대,어 나 이번에 여름휴가 갔을 때 일본이 너무 좋았던 게 기억이 나. 솔직히 그때 당시에는 너무 더워서 힘들었지만 어 지금 생각해 보면 참 그래도 집에 있는 것보다는 행복하지 않았나라는 생각이 들어. 맞아. 지금 생각해 봐도 하 그때 갔을 당시에는 아 집에 있는 게 참 편하다 생각을 했지만 어 그래도 나쁘지 않은 추억이었던 걸로 계속 기억에 남고 있어. 맞아. 우리가 일본은 한국이랑 많이 달랐을까 생각했었는데 정작 가니깐 도쿄나 오사카 같은 경우에는 한국처럼 건물 세워진 양식도 비슷하고 사람들의 노는 것도 비슷해 가지고 어 좀 신기했던 경험이 있어. 하지만 또 아쉬웠던 게 많이 다를 줄 알았는데 그렇게 많이 크게 다르진 않았어 가지고 좀 아쉬웠던 것도 있고. 맞아. 나도 가서 보디랭귀지만 많이 늘고 온 느낌이 들었어. 그분들도 내 말을 못 알아들었어 가지고 간단한 영어로만 하는 걸 보고 아 다음에 여행 갈 때는 그 나라의 언어를 좀 더 공부해야겠다는 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 나는 옛날에는 한국의 교통 시스템이 다양한 줄 알았는데 그래서 경주나 제주도를 갈 때도 버스나 그런 거 탈 때 어 너무 당연하게 생각하고 있었는데 일본 가니까 어 교통비가 차주하 차지하는 비중이 많은 걸 보고 어 그래도 한국이 살기 편한 점도 확실히 많구나 하는 걸 느꼈어. 맞아. 자판기는 어디 가든지 있어서 그런가? 목이 마를 때마다 마실 수 있어서 참 편했어. 그리고 나는 일본에서 건물만 보기엔 너무 지겨워서 자연 쪽 특히 호수 쪽에 갔는데 어 이제는 내가 일본인들이 추천하는 데에 한번 인터넷에 검색해서 가 봤는데 정말 풍경이 좋았던 게 기억에 남아 있어. 맞아 나도 특히 공원에 갔을 때는 공원에서 어 다른 나라는 뭐가 다를까 나무나 풍경이 좀 다를까 했었는데 그렇게 정작 가니깐 차이점이 없던 게 기억에 남아. 하지만 그래도 차이점은 있었던 게 아까 말했던 호수였는데 호수에 풍차 돌아가면서 큰 호수가 있어서 그런가 풍경이 매우 멋졌었고 아저씨들 할아버지들이 낚시를 해서 물고기를 직접 잡는 걸 봤었는데 그게 참 너무 운치 있고 멋졌던 거 같아. 맞아. 꼭 타고 싶었는데 그때 사정이 있어서 못 하게 됐지. 그래도 관람차로는 이용할 수 있어 가지고 관람차로 일본의 큰 지역을 볼 수 있다는 점에서 나는 좀 만족하고 있었어. 맞아. 나도 그때 기억에 남아. 풍경이 멋지다길래 갔는데 풍경이 우리나라에서 봤던 거랑 비슷하기도 했던 점에서 어 큰 차이는 못 느끼고 왔던 거 같아. 하지만 다른 나라에 왔단 이 기분 자체는 계속 유지는 될 수 있었어 가지고 좀 새로웠던 것도 기억에 남아. 그리고 우린 특히 겨울에도 많이 힘들었었지. 맞아. 그때 겨울에 우리 친구 중 1명은 폰도 아예 고장이 났어 가지고 못하고 있었는데 지금은 또 겨울이 좋은 거 같은데. 그때 겨울 당시를 생각해 보면 여름이 좋았던 거 같고 참 서로의 단점이 많은 거 같아. 그래서 겨울에 우리 일본 갔을 때도 일본에서 서로 멋진 사진을 찍는다고 특히 내가 그 잠바를 벗고 많이 찍었던 게 기억에 남아. 잠바를 벗어도 괜찮을 버틸 만한 추위였지만 이게 실내랑 바깥의 온도 차가 너무 심해서 그런가 계속 잠바를 왔다리 갔다리 벗어야 됐단 게 너무 힘들었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그걸 생각하니까 또 제주도에서는 우리 쪽에 아버지가 있는 옛날에 머물렀던 곳에는 바다가 있어서 그런가 바다에 사람들도 많은 유명한 x이어서 점점 옛날에는 솔직히 말해서 별다른 게 없었는데 요즘은 카페나 수제버거 집도 생기고 편의점 등도 생겨 가지고 어 먹을 것도 많아지고 바다는 뭐 옛날과 똑같이 계속 예뻐 가지고 참 보기 좋았던 거 같아. 맞아. 그에 대해서 인식도 안 좋아졌었지. 또한 바다 갔을 때 바다가 참 놀 땐 좋았지만 끝나고 나니깐 모래가 뭐 옷이랑 양말에 다 들어가 있어 가지고 또 정작 나올 때는 매우 힘들었던 기억이 나고 있어. 그리고 또 우리도 한번 산에 간 적이 있지. 하지만 산은 우리가 휴양지로써는 선택하기는 난 좀 알맞지 않은 걸로 보여. 넌 어때? 맞아. 지금 특히 여름 같을 때에는 산이 매우 덥기도 하고 겨울에는 또 사람이 집 안에만 있고 싶어 하니깐 어 그렇게 여름이나 겨울처럼 극단적인 더움이나 추위가 있을 때는 딱히 어 옳지 않은 거 같아. 한번 우리가 좀 있다가 이제 남해도 갈 건데 거기서 가능하면 한번 해 보도록 하자. 그리고 우리가 생각해 봤는데 요즘은 점점 이제 여행을 많이 갔다 옴에 따라 여행 계획을 잘 안 짜고 게 된 거 같아. 맞아. 이게 정작 지나고 나면 보람차다고 느끼게 될 때도 있지만 정작 그 당시에는 이거 시간을 지키느라 많이 힘들어 가지고 우리가 이번에 도쿄 갈 때는 아예 계획을 안 짜고 갔었지. 맞아. 미리 인터넷에 알고 갔으면 좀 더 색다른 소식이나 할인 이벤트나 그런 것도 많이 알고 재밌게 즐길 수 있었을 텐데 그렇게 너무 적당히 알아 보지 않고 많이 알아 보거나 아니면 아예 안 알아 보거나 이렇게 극단적으로 해 가지고 어 좀 여행을 못 즐긴 면도 있지 않을까 싶었어. 맞아. 나는 일본에서 현금이나 동전만 쓴다길래 어 많이 불편하지 않을까. 그 잔돈 같은 거 어떻게 할까 생각하고 있었는데 잔돈을 안에다 넣으면 그걸로 계산해 주는 시스템 같은 게 있어서 어 쟤들이 계속 동전을 쓰는 이유가 있구나 이런 좀 신기한 문화를 알게 됐어. 맞아. 옛날에는 나도 동전을 쓸 땐 몰랐는데 요즘은 카드를 쓰니깐 카드가 훨씬 편해진 거 있지. 일본도 카드를 쓰면 우리도 계산하기 편해지고 하지만 그에 비해 이제 돈 쓰기도 훨씬 수월해지니까 아마 더 사치를 부리고 오지 않을까 하는 슬픈 생각도 들긴 해. 아 맞아. 그걸 생각해 보니깐 여행 계획하고 그거랑 똑같은 뭐 약간 비슷한 일이 있었어. 처음에 동전 때문에 변수가 너무 많고 그러니까 정확히 말하면 내가 돈을 너무 막 쓰게 됐지. 그래서 여행 계획을 짤 때는 옛날엔 이 정도 돈이 남았을 줄 알았는데 알고 보니깐 고작 쪼금 밖에 안 남아 가지고 아 내가 너무 돈의 가치를 모르고 막 썼구나 하는 걸 느끼게 됐어. 맞아. 처음에는 동전은 다 계산하고 괜찮을 줄 알았는데 나중에 동전은 좀 쓰기 힘들 때도 많고 지폐 위주로 계산하다 보니깐 어 돈이 있어도 쓰지 못하는 1엔 10엔 같은 게 점점 많이 생기면서 돈의 차이가 생기더라고. 맞아. 그렇게 볼 때는 또 참 국내가 좋은 거 같기도 해. 국내가 어 문화 유산이 볼 것도 많고 하지만 이게 또 새로운 면은 없기도 하잖아. 하지만 그래도 언어 쪽에서는 확실히 편하고 즐겁게 여행할 수 있으니깐 난 국내에도 오랜만에 다시 가 보고 싶은 생각이 들었어. 맞아. 워터 파크 가기 전에는 또 매우 귀찮았었는데 가고 나니까 옛날에 갔을 때는 분명히 음식도 많이 없고 방수팩에 휴대폰을 넣은 사람도 별로 없었는데 요즘은 이제 줄 기다릴 동안 휴대폰도 할 수 있고 사람들도 음식을 그 쪼금 비싸지 비싸긴 하지만 그래도 괜찮은 가격에 먹을 수 있으니까 더 많이 오게 되는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826468017424665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26985400892540984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826468017424665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26985400892540984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826468017424665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22707062985882603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33678547672642395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826468017424665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3220214277349992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8220032001977906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5694828696849371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474998223299305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474998223299305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29244302687170154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474998223299305,0.0,0.0,0.3474998223299305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474998223299305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32313680222505636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474998223299305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29244302687170154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47346283789008853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33390020326847614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47346283789008853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3417029630194991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3599710590871957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4402686205201723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42724175730854885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33469405322641854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42724175730854885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42724175730854885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3972880743018643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42724175730854885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065058926086095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780059895929171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065058926086095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35778498660086194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065058926086095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780059895929171,0.0,0.0,0.3007851805694771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32555140992389137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739331831228942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3331590705763182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4616244402155994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30630184923403814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3509703937598558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4616244402155994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.448740149750138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4825730812359566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2947201694719193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.448740149750138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780396877737312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36689752444690255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6519527899110636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5738143639342271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4956759379573905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3977183021854763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3977183021854763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31156587183647716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3977183021854763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3347050463322694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3977183021854763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3977183021854763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119436861380899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44232899966844397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44232899966844397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44232899966844397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465131467748889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44232899966844397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4369860016617203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4465117968995035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45694612501041815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6331434974942434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3621215936747604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894238867170821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3621215936747604,0.0,0.0,0.3621215936747604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894238867170821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894238867170821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894238867170821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3168828446546952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37654080316033367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2717533412147054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3168828446546952,0.0,0.0,0.35014173597177317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37654080316033367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37654080316033367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33141129972034383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598827290917935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2912770644481093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34611434995476104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3046315448621556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6922286999095221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34611434995476104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32184846455086225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45339019860089214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45339019860089214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216032628557022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45339019860089214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45339019860089214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45174539510856293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434594128647182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42007377562535986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45174539510856293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45174539510856293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30553551142396324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273279664794178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24294985857840126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200698098136696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273279664794178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273279664794178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200698098136696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200698098136696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200698098136696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35200698098136696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32641495332771636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32641495332771636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.303530181712195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26440840623546197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32641495332771636,0.32641495332771636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32641495332771636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.303530181712195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32641495332771636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32641495332771636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26362171990360794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38195817971401935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38195817971401935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29921965525281286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22666198711825664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38195817971401935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35517930325531827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.282621635120762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38195817971401935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5258987432059954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21069181118260183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987561608715418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778105318782188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420037426096747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629493716029977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987561608715418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420037426096747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987561608715418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987561608715418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420037426096747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24545805787144867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20569389250135467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25671182696763534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25671182696763534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916692266941927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38280926199171195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38280926199171195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26420912393300405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35597071662583474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38280926199171195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3369284656452966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32215814828558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38280926199171195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21519890510043457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35236542819243866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2854292682703754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31013341330779165,0.35236542819243866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2607251232329592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26790139842314464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965377412127224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35236542819243866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965377412127224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965377412127224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47931422838541665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42186703292292377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3644198374604309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47931422838541665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47931422838541665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7227717713545807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6910868010119725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24039046030938743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21135870305032128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856475777210803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32587889773224027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32587889773224027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27424765459576944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6517577954644805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32587889773224027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27424765459576944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32587889773224027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19947028098538366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33142453391650084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33142453391650084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081885433801086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20240974600749245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33142453391650084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33142453391650084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33142453391650084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29170234572880277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081885433801086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081885433801086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25078897246474885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308311296762667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33266175825004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37796154125673476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37796154125673476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35146286690701284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2796644095505962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37796154125673476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37796154125673476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3264955324821409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.303923906565569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879632239575851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.303923906565569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879632239575851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3264955324821409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879632239575851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879632239575851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132994861588229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23819978849162937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23819978849162937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132994861588229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5826684653668415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29133423268342074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132994861588229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26366128602691785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132994861588229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22065394545452105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970271411377704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970271411377704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970271411377704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970271411377704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29728853387243676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29728853387243676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970271411377704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24306812569586134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970271411377704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31970271411377704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37025869460429434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39817448741568157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39817448741568157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39817448741568157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30272976137949315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37025869460429434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39817448741568157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7292833808496926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3646416904248463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33907686344067245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2953735030497809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3646416904248463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047447630460179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34018820913649384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34018820913649384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34018820913649384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.275565262194251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34018820913649384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25864312915783255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2994156691471632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34018820913649384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26649775830198663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.275565262194251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3750946463932784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40337504759915965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3394655545245571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40337504759915965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40337504759915965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3394655545245571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3750946463932784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625010277157354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2501926898510143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24053045173845397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625010277157354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625010277157354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625010277157354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2839772475172667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24053045173845397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370862814086397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31905423193692267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39157693636637514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37062997092169686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211000259916004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6245456451052143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3985613904530956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6716334976906728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1801466786690834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27833290362616725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993179170328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993179170328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27833290362616725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993179170328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21602079603700577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263443799664949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993179170328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263443799664949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993179170328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993179170328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993179170328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3731316901082488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2769463676383394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3731316901082488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40126409349058334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29690662549095964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40126409349058334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40126409349058334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27139276094060727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31719906924309754,0.31719906924309754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411144117482036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411144117482036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411144117482036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411144117482036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411144117482036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31719906924309754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411144117482036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093792443712346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093792443712346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21818352849602876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352192513190717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24236253013994244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889461034557821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093792443712346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093792443712346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2506088403505248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2876888368766062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093792443712346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093792443712346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2876888368766062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25410321028365207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28870538502025656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268464410355942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24296379809173732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268464410355942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25410321028365207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268464410355942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28870538502025656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24296379809173732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268464410355942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268464410355942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28870538502025656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28870538502025656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24296379809173732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34830977262026813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588874519892311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4260060891952829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45812497767965593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45812497767965593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3855410752727451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39204556401112794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27644754505785357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3446985451892655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658540341906416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658540341906416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658540341906416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3222624812149795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41137267740983335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38253156680685835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3620684731789315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41137267740983335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41137267740983335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33322736257595653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40228691403871164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3389053095947219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4326174864376636,0.4326174864376636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4326174864376636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40228691403871164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27151515116793407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27151515116793407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919861375771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4758084432640626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40084328409616754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4758084432640626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5116821988669221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35315526273152087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32917030945009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666403484718759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32917030945009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32917030945009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3060923613426964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32917030945009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2770175852362993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32917030945009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32917030945009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32917030945009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49997778197763176,0.26883689695786006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26883689695786006,0.26883689695786006,0.0,0.0,0.26883689695786006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17838145363810065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24998889098881588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21776801196527523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26883689695786006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22624321173467477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26883689695786006,0.26883689695786006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22624321173467477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6185474396055307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6185474396055307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4845597279127566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4518593452796078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4518593452796078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4518593452796078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29982241189002923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056125809949296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4518593452796078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23313534990961218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38735983276082786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38735983276082786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.360202249398346,0.0,0.3259877407175745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38735983276082786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.360202249398346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.360202249398346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4221154859359416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47959651416489457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44597226814806284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40361072802602804,0.0,0.0,0.47959651416489457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888464184197593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3046157863485621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888464184197593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888464184197593,0.0,0.3888464184197593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888464184197593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888464184197593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4103150021479392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5685315211467898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5286720910409434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784551479807177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.544493469580771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325365915981003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.544493469580771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.544493469580771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.523030028277331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15518848898669957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118370111115173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20486649201384777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615150141386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43730768721071533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43730768721071533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35423569732668564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43730768721071533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36802201182348576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4066482874329071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.505378132252383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39223600589991914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5434813056199687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5434813056199687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24265537826870937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351580312180736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351580312180736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351580312180736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351580312180736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351580312180736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351580312180736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351580312180736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27542214145842236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4670291184254475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5765523496925843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34213824496929496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5765523496925843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245459207775197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.358609101188257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245459207775197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38564656854536544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38564656854536544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38564656854536544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.358609101188257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2932048570723191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8658976515656112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5002212080801448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35294733334026224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5113809325986373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45009044996526254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4303593216563732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755282986070118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22839556771001987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794845738570681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794845738570681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3340022509917469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.273877890575341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2885199281264258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794845738570681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794845738570681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3193602134406621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37682182680787074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48101846425308564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48101846425308564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48101846425308564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4048073887467816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36197664912796623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36197664912796623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36197664912796623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835664580942683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27520875414867685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36197664912796623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36197664912796623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36197664912796623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2401825106046236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995075951620096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2834857750198567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32208908235953543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46556017642948216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46556017642948216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46556017642948216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46556017642948216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36471206244350884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474732126187246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30927183101885775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3671114230947293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39478992619310627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39478992619310627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30927183101885775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474732126187246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474732126187246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39855112445282814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39855112445282814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39855112445282814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3507836203973726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2876384147638199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39855112445282814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39855112445282814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5360479473164255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4511181709691357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4718010516828727,0.0,0.0,0.38687127533558296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3699721313159456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35255945193734156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4189340680115189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3687236092650219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3687236092650219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2779754895107703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4189340680115189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4189340680115189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070667397536506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39197509557962207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39197509557962207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070667397536506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.329871775591282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3644939386967578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39197509557962207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.329871775591282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2705961265839752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3432001226177081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31005764194555757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40781270426935384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31005764194555757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40781270426935384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3432001226177081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40781270426935384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691942502349003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38171127903576074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38171127903576074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902128792036865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33596207911972364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532770374712766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38171127903576074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549497126468836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32123412634813264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35149894042657803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35149894042657803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536803732627026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32685554436658215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29580853708451144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35149894042657803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35149894042657803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35149894042657803,0.35149894042657803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345215322671954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345215322671954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1975719063334834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19174876521799777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345215322671954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1975719063334834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345215322671954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17057636172245563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220337093833556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3025810596136789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30965193675081304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3776297666140911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4290530097739773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4290530097739773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3776297666140911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3989723408599782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22720177867123778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24433174178133668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24433174178133668,0.24433174178133668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21504787642418877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21504787642418877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21504787642418877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112411548776482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48866348356267336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22720177867123778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24433174178133668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24433174178133668,0.22720177867123778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25104000603705245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41710883738777244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38786556778531855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30103170561848214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41710883738777244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41710883738777244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41710883738777244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325365915981003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.544493469580771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.544493469580771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.544493469580771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32259602570534046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28393195974062996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28393195974062996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26131493102586517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32259602570534046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21405226981255054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999789969905757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5678639194812599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32259602570534046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739120341248166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2636939886458177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24810200137973948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739120341248166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3290975962507245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24810200137973948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739120341248166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739120341248166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739120341248166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4105452734227365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2833520967112997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38176217165509657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.321614306757872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4105452734227365,0.4105452734227365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29629471450675005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27767003590100114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41293075578661076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41293075578661076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3839804091714736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41293075578661076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41293075578661076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41293075578661076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.27708476432694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708476432694,0.27708476432694,0.257658504944159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708476432694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708476432694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257658504944159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444909518057266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257658504944159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708476432694,0.0,0.0,0.24387535456335369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708476432694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708476432694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708476432694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4315821554973989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4013241695773226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4315821554973989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4013241695773226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37985578691347516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4013241695773226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29491626758334105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29491626758334105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29491626758334105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29491626758334105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29491626758334105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742398513819952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42568816139809934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25956970062245815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25956970062245815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29491626758334105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29491626758334105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451706856890932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21357082150128737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263655421266841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451706856890932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283595896283353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4108985115428376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31240376337997683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4108985115428376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965496500637367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345797024145167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820906444462138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3616511374614072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4397021774018105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49957805050683346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4397021774018105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49957805050683346,0.0,0.3378868646156535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21612995227380782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591049671353856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591049671353856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591049671353856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3160651990315472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908885486510672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3160651990315472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3160651990315472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3339283167549056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2657118982705872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.408248290463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.408248290463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.408248290463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.408248290463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.408248290463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.408248290463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898984457520003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898984457520003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898984457520003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29643753473716333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898984457520003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898984457520003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898984457520003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245837313166949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.273157690335284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28568143309010885,0.0,0.0,0.3245837313166949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245837313166949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629250474356849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245837313166949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28568143309010885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245837313166949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24677913486352285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245837313166949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4499062774116074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37862452041748135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4499062774116074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4499062774116074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30429163429274614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959837098606093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42213842247884265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4707427583872727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5354029275486474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5599500985492849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063749860997266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21145535050859768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28489520548881353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22111395481821824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28489520548881353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2578338823083261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696550586096187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696550586096187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22111395481821824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2578338823083261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2032891169227738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063749860997266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063749860997266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063749860997266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5184618164229985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5575514390538671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3308627064649156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5575514390538671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5628579550879491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6052948412042057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5628579550879491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3100703799229918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4673039549624866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41129622547873007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4673039549624866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37853380398019776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39326576382705747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876038573123175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876038573123175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876038573123175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3139737230719726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876038573123175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876038573123175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876038573123175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401226,10대,나도 나도 그 생각이야. 여름이라서 아침마다 집안 호텔 안은 좋았지만 밖에 나가긴 두려웠어. 그래도 막상 나가니깐 새로운 경험도 하고 책이나 인터넷에서만 보던 걸 직접 눈으로 보고 일 그 나라 고유의 음식을 먹으니까 아 이게 여행이지 싶었어. 나도 계속 이제 좀 방학이라서 집에만 있어서 그런가 너무 똑같은 광경만 보고 있는 거 같은데 그때는 새로운 경험이라서 방학 때 집에 있기만보다는 이렇게 휴가 마 해외로 나가고 내 견문을 높이는 게 오히려 나한테 더 좋을 거 같아. 난 그래도 여행 갔을 때 재밌었던 게 처음엔 그 나라 언어를 모르면 어떻게 하나 했었거든. 하지만 막상 해 보니깐 그냥 영어랑 보디랭귀지만 쪼금 섞어도 되고 원어민이 그걸 오케이 오케이 하면서 알아 들으니까 뜻이 통한 거 같아서 생각보다 재밌었어. 그리고 특히 놀라웠던 게 그 나라의 각각의 문화였어. 우리나라 같은 경우는 교통비가 해 봤자 200원 더 먼 거리면 추가되는 그 정돈데 일본은 조금의 거리를 더 이동을 하더라도 바로 그만큼 비례해서 가격이 붙으니까 이게 돈 돈 계획 같은 걸 짜기에는 교통이 생각보다 비용이 많이 들었어. 대신 일본에서도 좋았던 점이 계속 가면 갈 가면 옆에 모든 곳에 다 자판기가 있었는데 여름은 계속 더우니깐 옆 음료수를 마시고 싶은데 커피 맨날 카페 가서 마시면 돈이 못 버티잖아. 그런데 자판기 같은 경우는 2000원으로 1병을 마실 수 있으니까 이게 호텔 옆에도 있고 모든 곳 옆에 있으니까 돈도 절약하고 너무 좋았어. 나는 은근 실망했던 게 공원에 갔거든. 공원에 간 건 좋았어. 공원 부지도 웬만한 그냥 우리가 생각하는 동그라미 공원이 아니고 그거의 한 10배는 증축한 공원이었고 사람들 사람들 외국인도 많고 막 뛰어 놀기 좋은 환경이었지만 문제는 그 당시 날씨가 너무 더워 가지고 쪼금만 걷기만 해도 땀이 나오고 이게 화장실이나 마실 것도 어디 있는지 모르겠고 너무 비싸고 오히려 차라리 그냥 집에 있었으면 했다는 마음만 들었어. 나는 내가 봤던 일본 환경이라면 역시 오사카에서 봤던 도톤보리가 기억나. 도톤보리에서 그 어떤 사람이 마치 마라톤을 뛰고 있는 거 같은 형태의 건물이 있잖아. 막 쭉 뻗고 있는 그 정확히 설명은 못 하겠지만 잘 아는 건물. 거기 앞에 강이 지나가는 강이 있었는데 그 배 위에 타 가지고 강을 이렇게 오사카 관광이나 그런 걸 하는 게 나한테는 새로운 경험이었어. 비록 못 해 봤지만 그걸 구경하는 것만 해도 좋았어. 아 맞아. 관람차에서 이렇게 가면서 일본의 야경 같은 것도 구경하고 고 이제 했는데 문제는 좀 경치 높은 타워 이름이 어디였더라? 좀 많이 높은 타워였는데 문제는 거기서 날씨가 흐려 가지고 막상 정상에 올라가도 이 광경을 굳이 봐야 되나 싶었어. 아 겨울 경주에 갔을 때 특히 기억에 남는 건 10원 빵이었는데 이 추운 날 뜨끈뜨끈한 치즈가 든 10원 빵 1개 먹자니 몸이 따뜻해지는 기분이었지. 하긴 그때 겨울에서 계속 걷 쪼금만 걸어도 바로 너무 춥고 해서 다리가 안 떨어지던 게 기억이 나. 그냥 여행을 갈 때마다 느끼는 건데 한 하루 있다가 가면 집이 호텔 안이 가장 편해 보여. 그리고 여행이라 하니깐 제주도도 기억이 난다. 제주도는 우리가 친척 일로 많이 가서 좀 익숙할 지 몰라도 한번 돌아 보니까 다른 게 있더라고. 일본보다 경주나 일본보다는 다른 특색이라고 할까. 돌로 다 기둥을 쌓아 놓으니까 이 길을 지나면서 딱 제주도란 느낌이 들어서 외국에 온 거 같더라고 마치. 하지만 나 제주도에서 그게 기억이 난다. 다 커피집 강 카페를 가는 걸 좋아하는데 모든 카페가 다 해변가 앞에 위치 있으니까 다 같이 사이 좋게 비쌌는데 1개 1개 가 파스타나 이런 것도 파는 대신 음료 1개가 7000원 8000원 모든 가게가 하니깐 오히려 사 먹기 더 꺼려지더라고. 특히 마지막에 이제 모래를 씻으려고 하는데 차가운 물 밖에 안 나온다 해 가지고 아무래도 추운 바다에 들어갔는데 다시 차가운 물을 하려고 하니깐 제대로 씻을 겨를도 없이 빨리 씻고 온 기억이 나. 나도 산이 좋은 건 맞는데 평소에 너무 갈 기회가 많달까? 오히려 옛날에 친구들끼리 그림 현장 체험 학습으로 그림 그리러 갈 때 휴양지로 많이 이용했던 편이긴 하지. 그런 면에서는 역시 계곡과 바다가 괜찮지. 계곡에 나도 해 본 적은 없지만 수박 같은 걸 놔두고 이렇게 시원하게 담근 뒤에 먹는 거라든가 그런 걸 많이 봐서 그럴까. 더운 날에 시원한 계곡에 놀러 가서 있고 싶어. 아 그거 맞아. 처음에 일본 오사카 갔을 때였나? 그때는 내가 나도 여행을 몇 박 며칠에 간단 것에 신나 가지고 우리 예전에는 부모님만 계획을 세웠는데 이제 내가 계획을 세우는 거니깐 1시간 간격마다 맞춰 놨거든. 근데 맨날 일정이 비행기 수속도 좀 늦어지고 다 택시도 늦게 잡히고 하니까 오히려 계획이 아무 쓸모가 없더라고. 오히려 근데 계획을 안 짜고 가면 좀 갈 데가 없을까 했는데 막상 인터넷을 검색할 때마다 1개씩 나오긴 하더라. 아 하지만 막상 마지막 날에 한 3일째였나? 중간엔 몰랐는데 마지막 날에 이제 한국으로 돌아간다니까 아 다른 데도 가 보고 싶었는데 이런 생각이 드는 게 참 아리송했어. 그래서 또 나는 여행에서 친구들과 새로운 방을 쓴 것도 좋았어. 이제 그동안 계속 자던 집이 아닌 새로운 방의 호텔. 핫 호텔의 화장실의 티브이 이런 가구가 여행 왔던 걸 실감나게 해 주고 일본에선 특히 편의점에서도 처음 먹어 보는 새로운 과자나 돈이나 화 지폐를 이렇게 딱 넣으면 알아서 계산해 주는 시스템이 마음에 들었어. 그래도 막상 살아 보니까 약간 불편하기도 했던 게 이 동전을 1개에 예를 들어 50엔이 필요하다고 하면 맨날 10엔 밖에 안 보이거나 5엔 밖에 안 보이거나 하면서 막상 찾으려고 할 때 동전이 안 보이는 경우가 많아 가지고 들고 있기 너무 애매했어. 이제 우리나라도 옛날에 현금이었다가 카드를 쓴 것처럼 일본도 카드를 쓰는 거 보면 10년 후면 이제 현금을 주로 쓰는 것도 바뀔 거 같아. 아 특히 여행 갔을 때 애들 다른 애들도 다 느끼는 감정인데 100엔을 다 100원처럼 생각하더라고. 우리나라에선 동전이 제일 비싼 게 500원이라서 그런지 100엔도 별 거 아닌 돈으로 막 자판기에 200엔 필요하면 바로 2000원이 아니라 어 뭐 대충 800원 200원 뭐 이 정도쯤으로 생각하니까 돈의 낭비가 나중에 심해서 깜짝 놀랐어. 그렇지. 특히나 한 3일차였나 2일차였나 갔던 음식점은 막상 가격을 다 알고 가는데도 막상 계산하고 보니까 3 2000엔이라든가 3000엔이라든가 한국 돈으로 2만 원 3만 원 등이 1끼 바로 1명당 나오니까 괜히 먹었나 싶기도 했어. 그리고 여행 갔을 때 괜찮기는 했는데 불편함 점도 있었어. 특히 말이 안 통한단 게 그때는 몰랐는데 예를 들어 마지막 날 공항에 우리가 약간 늦어 가지고 급하게 갈 때도 어디로 가야 할지 모르는 급박한 상황인데 다 일본말을 해야 하만 정확한 내 상황을 이해시킬 수 있고 그럴 때 옆에 있는 친구가 아니었으면 우리는 바로 다음 날에 다시 돌아왔겠지. 그치. 특히 어제 워터 파크 간 것 이틀 전이었나? 워터 파크 간 것도 기억에 나. 막상 여행 같은 것만 가다가 휴가라고 이제 바다가 아닌 좀 인공적일진 몰라도 워터 파크를 가 봤는데 옛날이랑 많이 달라져서 놀랐어. 그만큼 사람도 많았지만 먹을 것도 옛날에 비해서 점점 다양해지고 여 모든 곳에서 물이 나오니깐 더울 일도 없어서 이게 여름을 보내는 법인가 했어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4760722711501156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4760722711501156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4760722711501156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522593070498969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4426951078593924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
