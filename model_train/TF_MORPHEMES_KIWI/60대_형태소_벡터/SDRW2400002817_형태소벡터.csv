SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6400359320329367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5433019444593999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5433019444593999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가?

글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5673381800021676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5293947192835626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3429429280524441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5293947192835626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.42890102383064366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42890102383064366,0.42890102383064366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32249438906721567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42890102383064366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4002162116259983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270337540762791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310408468046177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35047939532956307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25743758348208046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2869684782162719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.327039405499658,0.0,0.0,0.2975085107654665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118567624973014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270337540762791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35047939532956307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35047939532956307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5512615903403107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4246523708880931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5907723216280354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40837370986978816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6696247808658096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4470750333985405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5930653988913114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30579521332683934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3361486517267694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778674322126536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3361486517267694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3361486517267694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43551549981484267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3361486517267694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405152843685972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36024153119422564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34976631444491824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4761771173238101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4761771173238101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4761771173238101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.444330489715907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3983749367814803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.352828027787633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863554286708169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3983749367814803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3983749367814803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3983749367814803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3983749367814803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5558897163558668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5558897163558668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336022594144105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5187119265297975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42619061470956576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4857018656909994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5205137158861431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46100246490470953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31463861257631187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38136413396340624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.287915207783884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4950670557843749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4950670557843749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5305501399557683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6502021305857569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6502021305857569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39303228717687416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40995163678146873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40995163678146873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891043629801718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891043629801718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40995163678146873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.439334218926973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.748605290050203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6630159271909322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5415107143305417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39775579273590167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5415107143305417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5052945892006834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3296168231743211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4278913921191347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4278913921191347,0.0,0.24884798459417976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.406131827798915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45855977553382676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29669043505927184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6066080959622132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3985443761538768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5149263370484092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4561138734604808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4524108428833118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5108129931258617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4052595794262414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5108129931258617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33049852440286936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38234577956928095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692075216595067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38234577956928095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4097497591322895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5471389126676381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4097497591322895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7750082233293843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6319511482478937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3389117562632264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4139185883534459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4139185883534459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3513596075551965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763527754649771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4139185883534459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4139185883534459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4769668138524101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8789213039194581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602597104437411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906968079841127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602597104437411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602597104437411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602597104437411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8176560429020286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5757070396528043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31924954579165793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5882908808614189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5882908808614189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4537702133265384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40292934699716043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4318086185374019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38243917775335445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4318086185374019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38243917775335445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2984894197817454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2882970554118027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563571833559177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563571833559177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6039648804669812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3991312757956348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.427738327080947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3299301727119242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.427738327080947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.427738327080947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.427738327080947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5473213983369857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31830466658115436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5473213983369857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5473213983369857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3713396296705911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43745601943956064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43745601943956064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43745601943956064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38744090135206505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3713396296705911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4463038964694294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4463038964694294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4463038964694294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3540805183374194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36542847225410496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3788502529873114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4944612540540084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43387674765369094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43387674765369094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46931641202257757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39843708328480437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5432193825528003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8395907946249497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31821383764924754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41308863022230746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328669893028942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4426960510053374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4426960510053374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26759961751286415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.392081830868954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40493040942710606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40493040942710606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3843384801398518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339531036932275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3843384801398518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339531036932275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6788388101191416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7342873210644644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017524443710071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6324382714906788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5901409300511209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3602503868144838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4021649071899184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.454080761333239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3414272514564151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42371193346648733,0.0,0.454080761333239,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5611791737464896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4763634680918155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45948702161296817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4970185692607358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8395907946249497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5432193825528003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2246745679068362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30410614976937994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4140146828817355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4140146828817355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4140146828817355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4140146828817355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4140146828817355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5947542451162758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4677885073389941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6537899512211277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7197412101277058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6942424579668875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7737272144259235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6335189007888407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4517133906687461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4517133906687461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4517133906687461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4517133906687461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42874240606940067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5231458246761788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6594037454277446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5399121656711793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4465025386293344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4465025386293344,0.0,0.0,0.47850484412676586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6101672558752548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.656921950371919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7539585871382817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28083396832116336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583344850001421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4828909418545241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583344850001421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.517501323893135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6383736051570492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7697266659268027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3512826593021152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48870107977866406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48870107977866406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40014279594057106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48870107977866406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204824948238151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204824948238151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204824948238151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25425860895000857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204824948238151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204824948238151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204824948238151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2990486915262801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19372432358423589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204824948238151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2990486915262801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30674212899592895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41760334461840254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41760334461840254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41760334461840254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3698580178502833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30674212899592895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38967411887437475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6039648804669812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563571833559177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563571833559177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2757357359255337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3667144094730542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3421886252384482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3667144094730542,0.3667144094730542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3667144094730542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3667144094730542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3667144094730542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.514867398618484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794046083311696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.514867398618484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.514867398618484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3559041308594364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106129855194719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.346752278597136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3653304298102758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2943834116330803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323419449839864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875793602888187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39151486329230367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106129855194719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.346752278597136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.477552951141842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5392007202881542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5031390870844469,0.477552951141842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4163146729605407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700571339578573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43861980957795776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700571339578573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43861980957795776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6672253639455171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7448559013042537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4229598065420941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5625148846459629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.433888247309549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5625148846459629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38600213400936484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3752858757660892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4865397770620253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4865397770620253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4865397770620253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5167120168148166,0.41636675713203003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3697088684499701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4271248466064298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4904356565701543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700571339578573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4163146729605407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43861980957795776,0.0,0.0,0.4700571339578573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43861980957795776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700571339578573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4163146729605407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700571339578573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43861980957795776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43861980957795776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39901375780583737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5029403924560248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694247393563877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44543833053015197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5029403924560248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34722171655882633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43765865958017347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43765865958017347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40838813849894784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37151164311063467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43765865958017347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6394305493385214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4269158525345174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6394305493385214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5169890956865586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4824129713649854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4824129713649854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5169890956865586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285197925459079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285197925459079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2861012705006051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285197925459079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285197925459079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285197925459079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8145734797388803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.580060381431185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3816334710726441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5075529746255023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4736079361385099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5075529746255023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33886778023482056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4652119544191062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6471984267661539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6039139291794576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110355774247951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110355774247951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110355774247951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3640411550611467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3170467326974984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30191790783563704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110355774247951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3628829596923339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3628829596923339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888919749412412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3628829596923339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888919749412412,0.3888919749412412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888919749412412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365766315417323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28570698803642774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365766315417323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365766315417323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365766315417323,0.0,0.0,0.3140664556927258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365766315417323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20345286039890575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3140664556927258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365766315417323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36879789689519243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6795951395523668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6341439564818717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.523057084130092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.523057084130092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632550453724974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48807513399022595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6958678893659744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7181698131704951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3372574472560027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32010689164492634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36142979774588496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36142979774588496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7228595954917699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38909331995514923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38909331995514923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41698091793037934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41698091793037934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38909331995514923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2697887092433224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3539591016311601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6884241922741361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7253083009946207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535533905932738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5115703630310326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.524788324464476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.680362387389298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44918463328069713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3978285620911763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41914325745046127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32287788798820166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3978285620911763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44918463328069713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734079775698009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40185786744708724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174654945874847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734079775698009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174654945874847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46669499085683736,0.46669499085683736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3961594706044307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43548252591559466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46669499085683736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285318207835664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285318207835664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45924610582701825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45924610582701825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45924610582701825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339105118906537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34424807889352926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339105118906537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4048906661555229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2897003846611926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2622889604573186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339105118906537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42011640949290463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4743496403107027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25741671703951036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4743496403107027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28673348683875727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4743496403107027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4769668138524101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8789213039194581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29469865076301976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30414347061323616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714555003968985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30414347061323616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368314408295738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34661263297703687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714555003968985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714555003968985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714555003968985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4850665992212826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45262544489355916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37414955996584615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4850665992212826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42960807959356434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.523057084130092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632550453724974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48807513399022595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.523057084130092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5169571377343384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5540091560759092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3982266822741785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5169571377343384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41810031734463515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41810031734463515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41810031734463515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549093168424533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41810031734463515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41810031734463515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5273267263317349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5796695316039658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.621216353476222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24278121954690055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41745965586869477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44738036243617335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34508079099153693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27043117642186315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41745965586869477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44738036243617335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.594950975923015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39721906212515035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45890738756328714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5269291817431511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563571833559177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6039648804669812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563571833559177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4813745550156084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4813745550156084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37130175160892137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40862038936245193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4813745550156084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43449657261221697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4656383710373907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4656383710373907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43449657261221697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43449657261221697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4780538777901535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4058015938804838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4233971349694889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44608173282850444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4780538777901535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8316726224830063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5552662865799066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7857600297337655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6185314670029262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3991809185873068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4702544025164686,0.0,0.0,0.4702544025164686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842580094432111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4388038848559676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535883521359919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6471444432229624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.762367411164487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25853459936486445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3185490606278393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29449434720961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3185490606278393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27742725642915295,0.0,0.24862391148677185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6712323028165926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2327088223979093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5513741014506931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5513741014506931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5144983150201543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356741761418962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439520109613006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439520109613006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39319419470846384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4142605918348963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28723913937765466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439520109613006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.504086376327564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.504086376327564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7012801511535106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6274656619350609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5505846179709327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5505846179709327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2363212631683794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40635183141778725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43547640367306006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632355061540486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3198704246782955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43547640367306006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3856876185468899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817553796850121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29810519427388577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27118699125682755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28294564849085635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3194713740201643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3194713740201643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29810519427388577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3194713740201643,0.28294564849085635,0.0,0.0,0.22083585406690104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29810519427388577,0.3194713740201643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20669955369871715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40932434676071977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30364420061259145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43125495855109075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46216441983478396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35648427368665564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46216441983478396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4072438843579684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43643239298144015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43643239298144015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43643239298144015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33663622284237166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3865343079119059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017524443710071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5901409300511209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6324382714906788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.636842789755396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49122007150548996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5942508750407572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32509380645780384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32509380645780384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033515995872098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32509380645780384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32509380645780384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32509380645780384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32509380645780384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2759596584198392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033515995872098,0.32509380645780384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49097039929846115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49097039929846115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49097039929846115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5261598626255416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5902079946180089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5902079946180089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5507350054045745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3797253457346846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.463764906834479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107418472595323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4327484053096313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406491751305239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107418472595323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6303553886907376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531050296532785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6303553886907376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27012629800757865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46447921967680844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46447921967680844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49776997303049886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49776997303049886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.4228061633401109,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5190708932312231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3731127498698625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39029389368227757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41181108294842783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5190708932312231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2008656213366955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707747721657607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057293475802933,0.2595219122949636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057293475802933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28528223173416206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28528223173416206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057293475802933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707747721657607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28528223173416206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848063841752173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057293475802933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057293475802933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28575626663743575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5715125332748715,0.0,0.0,0.28575626663743575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25308524878649075,0.0,0.0,0.28575626663743575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24256753025170502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28575626663743575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666449463342414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28575626663743575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666449463342414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40527560509352123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47743423759387654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3431839534707266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47743423759387654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42284833932949045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28859805520634046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26117647526264737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33904569709962923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3633462173373861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33904569709962923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24258812829673074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3633462173373861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3633462173373861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33904569709962923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3633462173373861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.399507690869441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4717898943676544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5557912829960203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5557912829960203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5409953376803962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5946948985017755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5946948985017755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.855797939614818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5173102420704933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4213252500192935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6412819324198131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6412819324198131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7097214662543531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5213116138997972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4738455882995638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄. 이제 그런 뭐든지 인제 좋은 점이 있으면 나쁜 점도 있거든. 그러니까 좋은 점만 있거나 아니면 단점만 있는 경우는 드물거든. 그래서 결국 우리가 어 장단점을 잘 비교해 보고 자기의 잘 맞는 주거 환경을 선택해야 되는데 어 주거라는 것이 사실상 뭐 우리가 호텔 생활하듯이 어 오늘 이 호텔 묵었다가 마음에 안 든다고 내일 저 호텔로 옮기듯이 이렇게 수시로 쉽게 옮길 수가 없고 한번 뿌리를 박으면 특히 인제 나이 든 노인일수록 이사에 대한 거부감이 크기 때문에 어 그 쉽게 옮기지 않는 그런 특성상 처음 자리를 잡을 때 잘 잡아야 되거든. 근데 그게 사실 쉽지 않거든. 그래서 암튼 우리도 이제 젊을 때야 사실은 뭐 이사에 대한 부담이 크지 않기 땜에 살고 싶은 동네 이 동네 살다가 아님 또 저 동네로 가고 뭐 이럴 수도 있는데 이제 우리도 나이가 들 만큼 들었기 때문에 이제는 좀 더 신중하게 어떤 주거를 선택할 때 그 환경적 요소를 우리한테 딱 맞게 잘 고려해야 될 거 같아. 내 말에 동의할까? 어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4688230581513944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5293438770266209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5293438770266209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4688230581513944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5341430495108084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5341430495108084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45341353960696346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.473073532782878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401865,60대 이상,어 우리 이사 온 지 아직 그 이제 얼마 안 되긴 했지만 사실 한 1년 됐으니까 얼마 안 된 건 아니지. 꽤 됐는데 어 나는 요즘 이제 그 우리 사는 주거 환경에 대해서 상당히 만족한 편인데 name1는 좀 불만이 있는 거 같아. 어떤 점이 불만이지? 글쎄. 지금 얘기한 것처럼 나는 이제 주로 차를 이제 이용하고 그리고 대중교통을 이용하더라도 주로 역까지 마을버스를 이용하기보단 그냥 걸어가는 쪽을 택하기 때문에 어 특별한 이제 불편을 못 느끼는데 아무래도 스 이제 당신 같은 경우는 음 그런 불편함이 현실적인 문제가 될 거 같아. 그렇지만 이제 반면에 어 아무래도 도심에서 조끔 떨어져 있다 보니까 아 환경적으론 좀 쾌 쾌적하고 어 뭐 공원도 많고. 그리고 또 뭐 스포츠 센터도 가깝고 그러다 보니까 그런 점에서 또 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 사실 모든 걸 다 갖추고 좋 다 좋은 데서 살기는 쉽지 않겠지. 그래서 결국은 어떤 건 취하고 어떤 건 버려야 되고 어 어떤 거는 어 유리하지만 어떤 거는 또 대신에 대가를 지불해야 되는 그런 상황은 뭐 어 주거뿐만 아니라 모든 세상사가 다 그렇겠지. 그래서 결국은 어 뭐가 더 중요하고 뭘 더 즈 우선시할 것인가. 그런 부분들을 우리가 선별해서 어 지금 살고 있는 곳에 만족해서 계속 살 것인지 아니면 어 이보다는 어 좀 더 개선된 어 특정 우리가 우리에게 더 중요한 부분들이 개선된 그런 환경으로 옮겨야 될 것인지 그에 대해서 우리 결론을 내려야 될 거 같은데 다음 예를 들어서 이사 날짜가 다가오면 어 name1는 어떻게 하는 게 좋다고 생각해? 좋은 지적인데 어 사실 이제 젊은 사람들이 사회생활이 왕성하기 때문에 교통이 편리한 역세권에 젊은 사람들이 살고 나이 든 사람들은 뭐 바쁠 것도 없고 뭐 특별히 활발한 활동을 하는 것도 아니고. 그러니까 오히려 공기 좋고 어 물 맑고 산 좋은 그런 데 사는 게 좋지 않을까라고 일반인들은 상식적으로 생각하는데 지금 지적한 것처럼 어 어떻게 보면 오히려 노인층들이 어 교통이 좋고 또 사회적 기반 시설 예를 들어서 뭐 병원이라든가 그다음에 스포츠 센터라든가 이런 뭐 쇼핑 센터라든가 이런 것들이 어 주변에 있는 그런 데서 살아야 되지 않을까. 특히 인제 버스는 노인들한테 상당히 위험한 거 같아. 우선 계단을 오르내리기가 쉽지 않고. 요즘은 이제 뭐 평평한 버스도 나오긴 했지만. 그리고 인제 차가 아직까지 우리나라 버스 기사들이 차가 출발할 때거나 설 때 어 노인들이 서있 다 자리에 앉은 다음에 출발하거나 서야 되는데 어 서 있는 상태로 그런 경우가 많아서 낙상의 위험도 크고. 그러다 보면 결국 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 사는 것이 좋겠다. 지하철역 주변은 지하철뿐만이 아니고 다른 편의 시설들도 집중돼 있으니까 지하철역 주변에 노인들이 살 만한 여러 주택들을 많이 짓는 것이 좋겠다는 생각이야. 내 생각이 어떤가? 그 노인들이 뭐 노인들의 어떤 주거 환경을 어 정부 쪽 정부에서 개선해 줘야 된다. 뭐 정부가 해야 될 일은 물론 많지만. 그리고 정부라는 것이 국민들의 생활을 편하게 만들어 주는 것이 어 정부가 할 일이니까 특히나 우리같이 지금 노인 인구가 많은 나라에서는 노인의 어떤 정치적 영향력도 커지는 거니까 무시할 순 없겠지. 그런데 이제 그 노인들이 츠 크 지금 세 도심에 살게 되면 어 활동성이 떨어진다. 난 그렇게 생각하지 않는 게 아무래도 인제 여러 시설에 접근 가능성이 높아지면 그 편의성이 증가함에 따라서 당연히 이용량도 늘어날 것이고 이용률도 증가할 거라고 봐. 다만 이제 name1가 지적한 것처럼 무슨 비용적인 측면이 문제가 된다면 그런 부분들은 사실은 정책적으로 배려를 해 줘야 되겠지. 예를 들어서 난 지하철 노인 인구에 대한 지하철 요금 어 면제해 주는 거 이거 굉장히 좋은 거라고 난 보거든. 그 지하철뿐만이 아니고 일반적인 대중교통수단에 있어서도 그 혜택을 더 폭을 넓혀야 된다라고 생각하는 게 노인들이 많이 움직이면 그만큼 건강이 유지되고. 그러면 결국 우리나라 건강보험의 재정도 그렇게 어 크게 지출이 나가지 않기 땜에 건보 재정이 건전하게도 될 수 있기 땜에 사회적 비용을 줄이는 데 최고라고 생각하거든. 아 그거는 이제 name1의 개인적인 어떤 특성 같고. 꼭 도시 출신은 이제 그런 거를 경한시하고 그 지 지방 출신들 그런 사람들만 예를 들어 전원생활에 좀 더 친화돼 있다 이런 거는 좀 편견일 거 같고 그렇지 않은 경우도 많이 있거든. 그래서 어 저 사실상 사람들은 다 각자의 특성들을 개성들을 갖고 있기 때문에 어 전체적으로 그 어느 특정한 분야만 이렇게 배려하거나 우대하면 안 되지. 그러니까 사회에서 이제 정부 차원에서 그런 여러 노인들의 성향을 잘 살펴서 그들의 어떤 어 주거 환경을 어 각자 취향에 맞도록 이렇게 여러 가지를 구비해 주면 각자 거기에 자기 취향에 맞춰서 자기 생활을 즐기면 되는 거거든. 어 어떤 면에서 난 인제 요즘 그 택배로 모든 조 이제 소위 쇼핑을 하는 이것도 젊은이들은 뭐 생활 편의가 좋아져서 괜찮을 거 같은데 나이 든 사람들은 좋은 점도 있고 나쁜 점도 있는 거 같아. 좋은 점은 뭐 몸도 불 불편한데 갖다 주니까 좋은 거고 나쁜 점은 그 때문에 더 안 움직이는 거 같아. 그건 어떻게 생각해?

어 나도 뭐 가 마찬가지로 그렇게 생각한다고. 어 좀 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 좀 더 어 심사숙고해서 주거를 결정합시다. 어 뭐 그래서 이런저런 저는 뭐 동네를 살펴보기도 하 실제로 했어요. 어 지금 사는 것보다는 좀 더 어 전철역하고 가까운 쪽으로 움직이고. 대신 또 어 번잡함은 쪼끔 좀 덜 하고 뭐 이런 쪽으로 가면 어떨까라고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48847878052234905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48847878052234905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48847878052234905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31144277923511676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4326301401896342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45760022421014934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5390751661900416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45760022421014934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5390751661900416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6324382714906788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017524443710071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5901409300511209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4368840886135343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35771564245150256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3869343603858884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4368840886135343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3869343603858884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4368840886135343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33343306164386655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42027862849426506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35675840159535527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3087072049042659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42027862849426506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42027862849426506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26795993875395857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25404879934775043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4630070860592425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43946178307960576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4961923267546914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31636075801362246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4961923267546914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5131152382282119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7138410175759667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4765960070375264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35598908298436593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5902079946180089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5902079946180089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5507350054045745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3373707475940168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3254184889791691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3708583947472385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.397439035657862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.397439035657862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.274731309333179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3373707475940168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3708583947472385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46650804171602034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46650804171602034,0.0,0.46650804171602034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3598346676699388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46650804171602034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36892958081483923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535976027214005,0.0,0.2994234582950018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38869593842064326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38869593842064326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4165550547543012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4165550547543012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6173589732229896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5859644125145325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5248938992287437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.6062759789882887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5146444156926065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6062759789882887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531050296532785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6303553886907376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6303553886907376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.474287949409908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886544909549098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6682871531358971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6343027412948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5757070396528043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8176560429020286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914551041449333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36527466734238295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914551041449333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914551041449333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914551041449333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36527466734238295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3466993518184603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173400753049074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894284569583846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173400753049074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173400753049074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173400753049074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894284569583846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6166940515996764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6166940515996764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48926157977420587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228061633401109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6119425616219109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5010514969054853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6119425616219109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734079775698009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40185786744708724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734079775698009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174654945874847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174654945874847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5351639575378627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5351639575378627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6536046795310033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8316726224830063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5552662865799066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4813745550156084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4813745550156084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40862038936245193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4813745550156084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37130175160892137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.474287949409908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32740602719896733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38570011373694163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38570011373694163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38570011373694163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24591347702981295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2975045654867301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38570011373694163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38570011373694163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4105493441820576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3801048998946916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5174805235311286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3890980809508407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5174805235311286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5435366911556408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5726580768291035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6137023646768603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5010514969054853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6119425616219109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6119425616219109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3932720867160586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7865441734321172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30334510442047247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.366970130493092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36647027176019303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49891813586617784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49891813586617784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3448791397395101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49891813586617784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24225946165836215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370290487274461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29849592328865343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370290487274461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46594533265683474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370290487274461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370290487274461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3144886153101679,0.2860910276260871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3213319429466761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3213319429466761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41713639211638154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39592375189567425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44703392930751223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794699498521262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34481357448383626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46669499085683736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46669499085683736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3961594706044307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43548252591559466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46669499085683736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35825702516759267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6601711535344705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6601711535344705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32313819989652115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5556326060911468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5273770168146853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5556326060911468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38343164960206505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38343164960206505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715246280636412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715246280636412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36121029685331085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28307146634576635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4682914776495779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42448810836116235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42448810836116235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47928568598482385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47928568598482385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42448810836116235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29681668749928225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20302762381677558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741251983873384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3313508047446977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3491037821153082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741251983873384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741251983873384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741251983873384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28130797220063725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.338131990244007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033360423676934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4129662470906937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38534714947499016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4129662470906937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5514338895039799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39254396853215695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31858890884039187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3516321637646536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44321784646336043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41357552810748505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2867641313287141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41357552810748505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3087047865232652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34462206389009514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34462206389009514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38910965712268736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38910965712268736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24808732308069742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38910965712268736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38910965712268736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.474287949409908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082817266846359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26590093474373355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4572137536850938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48998376719492626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48998376719492626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48998376719492626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5055444020689221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6228980367824754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5970116358240549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32356129662859334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.450135384852531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.450135384852531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.450135384852531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29123981276377453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.450135384852531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4931648738398078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35449127396096913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4931648738398078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38039605455002906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4931648738398078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6303553886907376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531050296532785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6303553886907376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5646418410553457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48859116910693057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6651753609390176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5739238954990419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4553293664072936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36592060947361527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5739238954990419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37685182885684787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.393192109277408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.393192109277408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439496563199467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439496563199467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.393192109277408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6887252339260403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4005406267998302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6043382814585883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.523057084130092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.523057084130092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48807513399022595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632550453724974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4609273013410058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6275133555863562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6275133555863562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37530955192892507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4237586224673838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4237586224673838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4237586224673838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4237586224673838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37530955192892507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26869929564609524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4385301180839142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5187119265297975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336022594144105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5558897163558668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5558897163558668,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42768743365946216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583411987005269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24872936885998825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583411987005269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583411987005269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35353528378025756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.526677935589454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39601369461913605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49145382364916806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3868606737465546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41784622071559624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43332957934277366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43332957934277366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38378624442787257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35480525134198626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40434858625688735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43332957934277366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6183513704468101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6626706469341088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4225034868003833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3956256514113092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5503906267874235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48746349589940746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5503906267874235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6394305493385214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4269158525345174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6394305493385214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406369987190233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3563226949726686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44219721003767604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44219721003767604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37596702708152063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4738909384746499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4824129713649854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5169890956865586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4824129713649854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5169890956865586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5860615112055864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4974851296230411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37365927268615384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5190560652020406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37484668549494915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.427188511922193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4578065176013862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30565455460305785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4578065176013862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4054646911741424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27690064067165787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24804144053283972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31264601033543393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31264601033543393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31264601033543393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31264601033543393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24804144053283972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29173630950770935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20873813142325331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29173630950770935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31264601033543393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31264601033543393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46280938934868227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43185679263663623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3569817621969011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46280938934868227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4098955757727917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2994399561442724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4270528093094172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465963037054426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4821814666418509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4821814666418509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4821814666418509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5318211565250631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4354490164185178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38227775191710744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49625306702709443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3676234832378018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5919905844138624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8059448789869773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40774992741586696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48034910879925796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48034910879925796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3107882410838985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38109069352077435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3611786490916984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453212670520752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453212670520752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3947070115783399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453212670520752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4774947129018716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3148623383646335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34611578568983403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26662276416582653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37092304243048335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2861064714192944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37092304243048335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37092304243048335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37092304243048335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2789002434435903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4693473362771854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4693473362771854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4693473362771854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34474963628413374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4693473362771854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4639688549574001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173625274934009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5848136146553529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5848136146553529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.473073532782878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45341353960696346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5341430495108084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5341430495108084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37089749374209646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3433934476522125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46750100069075123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46750100069075123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29806783171754225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46750100069075123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6630159271909322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.748605290050203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2769828704034818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3350785577716976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35909474008583797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35909474008583797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35909474008583797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23233606685090552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35909474008583797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3350785577716976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35909474008583797,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228061633401109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531100716828129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36730727605965735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25124437610734063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43201196115770296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46297567930800554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43201196115770296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46297567930800554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42936970105253186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5070547840102682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44914137217620764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5973350262876213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2805280985680959,0.0,0.0,0.2895187652950706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32994580265968054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35359410353323045,0.0,0.0,0.31316706616862044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35359410353323045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26587046442152074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35359410353323045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24442332614706364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35359410353323045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6853220003269466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24630775817205927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3426610001634733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3426610001634733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3426610001634733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3426610001634733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6394305493385214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4269158525345174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6394305493385214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125289066070321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5759065539360003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5759065539360003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48886497604362567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4609273013410058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6275133555863562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6275133555863562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4152404897009248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30500654148870265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524817188875831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4152404897009248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4152404897009248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4152404897009248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30500654148870265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45796255939590336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.300883558513605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3532432254743711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45796255939590336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42733411767360674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42733411767360674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4213252500192935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6412819324198131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6412819324198131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7860090411611904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6182150007989665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40185786744708724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734079775698009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734079775698009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174654945874847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174654945874847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26015768394021066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959753712444283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908557365996651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959753712444283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25246474370319044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959753712444283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959753712444283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959753712444283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.346339303718686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3016300303472344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36489532873334746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3910485770901376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3910485770901376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530103568964775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36489532873334746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3910485770901376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31208495895984745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42487715363173634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42487715363173634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42487715363173634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42487715363173634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42487715363173634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4227674172234216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4227674172234216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4227674172234216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32609592863325787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4227674172234216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4227674172234216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4552949180652806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612136525363945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42484488764616724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344277154101531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4552949180652806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.403240247241811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809637884448445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5177405473968819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5177405473968819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48311416613957336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892935951442555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46038821463349955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4933857522003562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4933857522003562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3546500432804699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4188162337817351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42785512855967034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5546932413571964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5175954715327999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49127418495843345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4019778536734224,0.4019778536734224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3750936575480209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4019778536734224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26838054309183795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25629178775205746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31006018000286056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3750936575480209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35825702516759267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6601711535344705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6601711535344705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4557599483730059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3208980266798773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2650554479483257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.376740605411429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4884257628745324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4884257628745324
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4746041306837068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42034180353280937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44286270409856837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4746041306837068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42034180353280937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4385301180839142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26869929564609524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26869929564609524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4385301180839142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49514039222985384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39299349654888216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4799695210255777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4799695210255777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39299349654888216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4799695210255777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6446243112853232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6446243112853232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.410997560333204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24312891402609899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37005657697146727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37005657697146727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37005657697146727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37005657697146727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37005657697146727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3453072692623957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37005657697146727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7630079828310886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35598908298436593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815039914155443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017524443710071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5901409300511209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6324382714906788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41116968429584894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5720153368425147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4201623490389649,0.0,0.5720153368425147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3515713132027229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41275164809104953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41275164809104953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5351123178677027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49932411617646943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3587836351918398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2975575783034477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3587836351918398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2975575783034477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4050993592657797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27046461652644477,0.0,0.4050993592657797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4050993592657797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6822349667690659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.731132990718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5080512625920596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46217541979489896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3913662351465864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4199656879290406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4458016227712699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836743923160725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3398082224930562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836743923160725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836743923160725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836743923160725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30439265437462926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29594205267003987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3398082224930562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140448483794452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140448483794452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4552731944268841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140448483794452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6243459237814833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6243459237814833,0.0,0.0,0.46945109959919423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33684503363028256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4686155928682593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4686155928682593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3977897959582336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4372746784597585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31287123448712123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26978128655579103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3400481900267847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173058370607553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3400481900267847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3400481900267847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21680686572007096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3400481900267847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173058370607553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3400481900267847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173058370607553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741136111442113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094992004893836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094992004893836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887999576565397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094992004893836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6189984009787672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094992004893836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741136111442113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4552731944268841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140448483794452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140448483794452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140448483794452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948582635501736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948582635501736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948582635501736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31326551198334773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948582635501736,0.3948582635501736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34971342200796246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4958081042267042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5598124486185789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3569234771298511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5598124486185789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33173788301835216,0.0,0.3555146281853885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28205176970270923,0.0,0.0,0.3555146281853885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3555146281853885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33173788301835216,0.3555146281853885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33173788301835216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29109126868371743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35024289775793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35024289775793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41194152962378244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34051939363824524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2814689850176418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4414667339340842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4414667339340842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45996012369018496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45996012369018496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3378544482752708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4291980852789916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4291980852789916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070924098640775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594040967456716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3786601018769906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594040967456716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3786601018769906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3786601018769906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594040967456716,0.0,0.0,0.2805108015737461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.321946203063896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40482722238935415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2659733918343915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21968878164940403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3777524610706399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40482722238935415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34364229582490935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585426122043666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40482722238935415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5836675541442465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8119927254842084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4127190957938954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4127190957938954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4127190957938954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4127190957938954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4127190957938954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3851165276060572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까?

그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799704306268121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799704306268121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4072041611185539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36064779133729885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36064779133729885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3456599879087479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4072041611185539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45672291825917327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3883171442064673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4894577519796645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3595213372464631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37753661624828033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3595213372464631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,음 나도 처음에 이사 와서는 어 집 구조가 마음에 들어서 어 상당히 좋아진 점이 예전보다 많다고 생각을 해. 그런데 그리고 이제 공기도 좀 더 깨끗할 것 같고 이런 기대감들 이런 거를 갖고 이사를 왔지. 근데 지금 살아보니까 어 예전하고 비교해서 불편한 점을 먼저 말하라고 한다면 우선 교통 문제야. 뭐냐하면은 역에서 쪼끔 떨어져 있는 거는 환경이 같은데 뭐 마을 걸어도 갈 수 있고 마을버스도 탈 수 있잖아. 그런데 마을버스 숫자가 그렇게 많지 않다는 거지. 어 예전에는 그냥 가면은 뭐 10 몇 대 되는 버스들이 다 역을 통과하기 때문에 가자마자 탈 수가 있었는데 이건 좀 어 기다려야 되고 그런 불편함이 있어. 딱 2대 에 라고 생각되고. 그래서 어 나처럼 당신은 운전을 하고 다니니까 뭐 별 크게 어려움이 없는데 나처럼 대중교통 이용하고 왔다 갔다 할 때는 어 이거 좀 음 불편하다. 예전에는 집 앞 거의 근처에서 바로 뭐 몇 미터 앞에서 마을버스 서서 겨울에도 상당히 편했었지. 지금은 조금 걸어야 되는 상황이고. 자긴 어떻게 생각해? 음 지금 상황에서는 어 우리가 좀 더 나이가 들어간다는 것을 가정했을 때 어 지금은 뭐 몇 년은 충분히 가능하겠지만 앞으로 점점 차량 운전이나 이런 게 어려워질 수도 있고. 그리고 버스를 타는 것도 사실 뭐 어 좀 더 연로하신 분들 보니까 상당히 오르내리기 위험하고 어 출발할 때 뭐 위험도도 뭐 낙상 위험도도 있고 해서 내가 보기엔 지하철이 있는 역세권 그곳에서 쪼금 더 쪼끔 걸어가면 있는 주택이 있는 곳이 좋을 거 같아. 근데 물론 그렇게 되면 좀 번잡할 수도 있고 또 주택 가격이 또 상승할 수도 있으니까 그런 어려움은 있으나 환경적으론 그런 게 좋다고 보고. 예전에는 전원주택 같은 거 나이 들어서 우리가 이제 뭐 아름다운 자연도 느끼고 한적한 데 가서 조용하게 편안한 그런 생활을 하는 것도 꿈꿔 본 적이 있는데 지금 어 내가 지금 나이 들어가는 입장에서 보면은 편의 시설이 가까운 것이 정말 좋은 거 같아. 물론 배달 서비스도 많고 이런 것도 좋긴 하지마는 제일 먼저 생각할 게 병원. 뭐 많은 선배들이 그런 얘기들을 하더라고요. 어떻게 생각해? 음 정책적으로 그렇게 해 주는 게 참 어 연로한 사람들한테 필요한 정책이고 좋은 거 같아. 근데 현실 가능성은 어 잘 모르지 우리가. 근데 실현 가능성이나 그런데 어 내가 생각해도 예전에는 어 이런 격언도 있더라고. 나이가 들면 더 반짝반짝하는 데서 살아야 된다. 그 얘기는 뭐냐면 어 활기찬 것 도심 오히려 그런 것들이 그 노년에 정신 건강에도 좋고 내가 꼭 섞이지 않아도 지나가는 젊은이들이을 보고서라도 그 활기를 얻는다고 해. 너무 한적한 곳에 동떨어져서 유유자적하게 지내면 더욱더 느려지고 그 생각도 줄어든다는 그런 통계가 있어. 그건 이제 뇌 활동인데 일종의. 어 그런 것들로 여러 가지 상황으로 봐서 노인들이 도심 주변에 사는 것은 오히려 정신 건강이나 활동에 더 도움이 된다. 이런 얘기들이 많지. 근데 또 한편으로 또 반론도 있어. 어떤 거냐 하면 그 소일거리가 필요한데 도심에서 노인들이 소일거리가 그렇게 쉽지 않다. 왜냐하면은 다 비용을 음 들이는 것이고 어 이런 것들이기 땜에. 특히 어 우리나라 같은 경우에는 연령에 따른 어떤 그 세대 차이들이 있어서 어떤 것에 가서 끼는 것도 쉽지 않잖아 지역 사회. 음 그렇지. 정책적으로 여러 가지가 좋은 의견이긴 해. 근데 그것을 어 얼마나 반영될지는 모르겠어. 근데 그 개인이 선택할 수 있는 거는 내가 보기에 어 주변에 또 좋은 얘기들 하는 사람들 보면 주거 활동을 좀 더 한적한 곳에 가서 그거는 예전에 아마 농촌 출신들이 그렇게 많이 하는 거 같은데 텃밭을 일궈서 스스로 인제 먹을 채소와 신선한 음 뭐 야채 그런 것들을 재배하면서 활기를 얻고 그러니까 몸을 움직인다는 거지. 그리고 바람과 햇살 뭐 이런 것들을 맞으면서 건강도 증진되고 거기서 나온 수확 가지고 보람도 느끼고. 또 맛있게 먹음으로써 저비용으로 아주 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다라고 해서 텃밭들도 많이 유행하고 전원 생활하시러 가시는 분들 대부분은 마당에 그런 것들을 염두에 두고 하려고 해. 근데 긴 안목에서 보면 사실 음 그 그것을 일단은 좋아하는 사람들에 국한돼 있는 거 같고 나 같은 경우에는 사실 어 도시에서 태어나서 도시에서 자라고 여태 살았기 때문에 사실 좀 지금 뭐 고추니 파니 뭐 응 그런 방울토마토를 기르기는 쪼끔 아 내가 적응할 수 있을까? 그리고 인제 관절도 시원치 않아지는 나이가 되잖아. 그래서 쪼금 나는 조금 그 생활하고 먼 먼 거 같아요. 그래서 도시를 더 선호해. 음 나도 어 지금 뭐 어 택배로 모든 식료품을 어 배송받는 사람으로서 어 아파트나 이런 대도시에 사는 이점 중에 하나라고 봐. 그래서 나는 그것을 나의 특별한 수혜라고 좋은 혜택이라고 봐지는 게 일단 첫째 내가 뭐 바쁜 사람은 아니지만 어 오가는 시간을 줄일 수 있고 교통비도 절약되고. 그다음에 내가 그 무거운 것들을 혹은 가져오거나 뭐 옮겨야 하는 그런 수고로움도 번거로움도 다 그 그쪽에서 다 대신해 주는 거기 때문에 나는 어 아주 좋다고 생각해요. 어떤 때 보면은 주거 환경이 도서 뭐 산간 이런 데에는 그런 혜택이 없더라고요. 그래서 아 그런 데 가면은 나는 살기 힘들겠구나. 혹은 지금도 해외에 다른 나라들은 어 그런 시스템이 안 갖춰진 곳이 많아요. 뜻밖에도 선진국일수록 그런 데가 많고 오히려 뭐 런던이나 파리 같은 데서는 이런 서비스가 없습니다. 그래서 지금도 옛날 파리에 살던 여인하고 똑같이 주부들이 봉지에 종이 봉지에 식료품을 들고 그 좁은 언덕을 오르거나 주차하기도 쉽지 않잖아. 그렇게 사는 사람들도 많아. 그래서 나는 어 한국이 주거 환경으로 지금으로서 지금 내가 사는 곳이 편하구나라고 느끼고 있지. 당연히 동의하죠. 그 나도 좀 많이 생각해 본 거기 때문에 어 예전에는 미래에 대해서 젊은 시절엔 별로 어 기 뭐 기대만 있고 부 부족함이나 어려움에 대해선 생각을 못 해. 안 하거나 못 하는 거겠지. 근데 지금 우리 나이쯤 되면은 정말 어 나의 여생은 어디에서 자리 잡아야 할까 이런 고민들을 해야 될 것 같고. 그냥 예전처럼 어 이 동네가 좋네 아님 어 이 집이 좋네 하고 단순하게 이사할 수는 없다는 거지. 예전에는 뭐 직장과 직장 거리 혹은 아이들 교육 뭐 이런 거를 중점으로 뒀다면 이제부터는 좀 우리의 편리 예를 들어서 아까 말한 뭐 기타 등등 시설 기반 시설과 또 주변 환경 이런 것들을 많이 고려해야 될 거 같고. 그 점에 있어서 난 지금 사는 동네도 괜찮고 그 주변에 있는 가까운 곳 다른 곳도 염두에 두고 있거든. 음 그래서 어 그런 쪽으로 이사 갔으면 하는데 당신은 어때요? 그렇게 할까요? 아 그럼 뭐 그 점에 있어서는 의견 일치를 본 거네. 그러면 다음번에 살아야 될 곳도 이렇게 좀 생각을 해보고. 그리고 인제 여러 가지 음 어 것들을 고려해서 우리도 한번 뜻을 맞춰 보자고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4634837238266428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4634837238266428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4634837238266428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4104928124008041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43248602776349093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
