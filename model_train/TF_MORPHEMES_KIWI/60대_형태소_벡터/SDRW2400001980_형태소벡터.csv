SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5849398455056373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.421790713920873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6927755558548248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5268878293253259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29067485626081835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5268878293253259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875339525417673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5268878293253259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4070109425414121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6685003312116998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6224543355310485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5599357732200091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5599357732200091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4068449366123586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45543501983258505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.560160627959692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4531096617813766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6934779775048159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3658918971356305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38111657416115235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5364808633165878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38111657416115235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5364808633165878,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6420516277211918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5421114771615558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5421114771615558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6071303813301749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.512625984643534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6071303813301749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5222510472520413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4735786341613526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3689008172062328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45620669799614955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39845295415900417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5791392749324118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8152286183830646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.715657063295651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6984518363889127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7322777330205967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.415005965125831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30154007593479454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2264776273800813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38642054491670164,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2659104000774213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48199887425456334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48199887425456334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48199887425456334,0.0,0.48199887425456334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43523908418491003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5846132963248233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.415309905607748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5443454010664447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4070109425414121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6685003312116998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6224543355310485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7363183521878165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6766352667659428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4847601928662942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6158161381908193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33973505837270734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.519959738314874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4891808718358322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4238304350943477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4414659212540917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6214319570869743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3655570027775589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494350106882066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3537877443454892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41847813363868863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494350106882066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24526629358530888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3192791081543021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.661578085045183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.749876281387769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4857208196343727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45226459273565467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4857208196343727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45226459273565467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34505658530555705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31338738438990343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26494243526081923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33657018403363465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5475122532676131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27375612663380655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31338738438990343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33657018403363465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2390998156219252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27375612663380655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23339142265758522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8461075832225721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3732390585915438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3005378621485567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7234764006610195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6903491129034469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3711790259616975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986369563681091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365861247559133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986369563681091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986369563681091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986369563681091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365861247559133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28298068229659207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35948510937769124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31715561108855506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35948510937769124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33472394020420626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29239444191507014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29239444191507014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33472394020420626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31715561108855506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553786028843364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.491548862074762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36595349080579903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37578875867443073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.491548862074762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.491548862074762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4476459655683675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725455738228257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4476459655683675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4476459655683675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4476459655683675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3523794378664034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.421790713920873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6927755558548248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5849398455056373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3002777054221851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161126114000404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4284593974232025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5068035618512657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5442943034010579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3804448233735804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39310086790025073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.483298887516588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.483298887516588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.483298887516588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6129583670697472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4985620126708194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6129583670697472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3992377914445327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45710529348341583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5619892955172421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5619892955172421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.438543890978512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5391689307867221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5391689307867221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47568159921741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40351280976401993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.286655927923849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3004114803454474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22261100266397368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40351280976401993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40351280976401993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35599903424180473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40351280976401993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34591686339589234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4869317948684234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4869317948684234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4111372095262051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4869317948684234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48797576334237747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4120186764785342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38412638201863636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4543642169570547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48797576334237747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43589742003662335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5165550277342584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5854975732805101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4476124821880068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4582021198568454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.700742575306538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5468186724239159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563647900622942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3685585434926875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5111174105431788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5340642627826115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24045514639667515,0.0,0.35256201500408374,0.0,0.3282777053903331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35256201500408374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35256201500408374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35256201500408374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35256201500408374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35256201500408374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976830935282901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7318625922550115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6814522331446092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5479411514055672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5278414298010189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6489560228412686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32629730488486414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47282509836797615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5359311841273718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4218760894183388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45250947640365546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084195621186179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22531797264125808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084195621186179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084195621186179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084195621186179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084195621186179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22288328645153493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25597296384497054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7363183521878165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6766352667659428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3576090332260642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5873595330464508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5873595330464508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42677082519079274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49443385827832875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.272770564599236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38921008663848916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46037748128089984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251953824918008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46037748128089984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3634249407838741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6587572817116474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6587572817116474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6244874701958779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7810348260918668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6257011042622715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6257011042622715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46582856959395263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6814522331446092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7318625922550115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32161555557115973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2601523711855092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4715616614076089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3426330008188542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37120547474426435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43908071082232136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3981595525982319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31612459337016263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4887902744907495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3975673979115472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063445213323448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4127064028586942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4887902744907495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5851316527150272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4251520648336798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5851316527150272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36672553735678143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4570202172610392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4570202172610392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4570202172610392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33206730167082227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2864329488591061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42554087466770246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45664326508969466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519221512715204,0.0,0.385563316539318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028733597330548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45664326508969466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45664326508969466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.394219979073664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5780162839509121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.419982093754385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5780162839509121
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2641824232117668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47886668046394487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47886668046394487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34794077031148024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38949584317515695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4458825635222467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.332326974764911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46052518322555974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6023879760794394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5608957690458929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3263183511019168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.308620530391927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4145392087749346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36572707088417555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4145392087749346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4145392087749346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3859859385288103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36547513600892934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358697965758381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2956300514544996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4524576442848594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358697965758381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39947742451607743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4527940879027465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3289966292595873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5675685272797205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4527940879027465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30800089791914964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42049350800860524,0.0,0.4515994721705986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4515994721705986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5660710998400186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36946148012480484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41877203476757907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535870272108174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41877203476757907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41877203476757907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27543164721225877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36946148012480484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43050924215371994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40085596334567536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40085596334567536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43050924215371994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43050924215371994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3501633483977304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5304262689078795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948973534444082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5304262689078795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5304262689078795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48856730284612054,0.0,0.0,0.4130421882069598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5247090190048922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451077374157902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44303412543680126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3647833861673325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39176819977539284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39176819977539284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39176819977539284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39176819977539284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3186525426093391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25767088446917386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916677290012788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4538970797973601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33792209408703405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4226328574776394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4538970797973601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4538970797973601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298533832190601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5504006349624992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3441729483250988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5808892000782041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49109251664690495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5256131909190059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41375393725718407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5256131909190059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5256131909190059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44164967681938444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112290499898872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44164967681938444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112290499898872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44164967681938444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27679961305036077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3996603070125802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47273853331890375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5077093178740607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5077093178740607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3182018466348269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755841685947906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4428261495625352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35406792711233337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755841685947906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755841685947906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.468587602173368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3488590494134469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.468587602173368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.468587602173368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.468587602173368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5905916006310169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5499119225186766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5905916006310169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48304947090254136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8755930611081697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7448427472536043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.529137077447917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40647661080753505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31527961875758304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24385096113781998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40051613175077666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40051613175077666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2910118767681353,0.0,0.0,0.40051613175077666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2634245096247266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845270846856935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35335521612046145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4612940431979832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6493431231175221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.604616667128884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4212381009304978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4721100614718653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5351207140999765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35195564055216483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4352511925384533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4130031841444715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44355505236623766,0.0,0.0,0.3302225522257145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44355505236623766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36077442044748065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44355505236623766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6814522331446092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7318625922550115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36853963472101875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5340368627958801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43981541127898743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47649201376832623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3981217547827957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33518483326116816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44778352167129387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40986336333797524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4648347109424545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5505286188452555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590471797383339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6341518880821425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4991937893611489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4477120267061593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.423430440483394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4477120267061593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3103800828005888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5687519218060412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41305643651518553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33596775800633566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41305643651518553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3487611046873213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3846052989410736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41305643651518553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251511375100086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4402340216778125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3717082949163811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40991090452406354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4402340216778125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40991090452406354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3717082949163811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42157237987787044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49865724730314787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5355453660690921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5355453660690921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063187590513871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5031171658520557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42480320614315453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4684626866183738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5031171658520557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5763103395105494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5597029772081552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5954821322907704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40323984826552406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174236829694776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3082765798463382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3754648727799534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26521593231753476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6559664771407211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5443725738052867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5443725738052867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45963690047675193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44277637865782743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331254953379771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6168765287629377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29224956590591905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331254953379771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3084382643814689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331254953379771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331254953379771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39664015560799926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4131442605410639,0.0,0.0,0.58156481401316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3825025106397975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43296951786162713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5999366504277769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5999366504277769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5292938984600132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5391689307867221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5391689307867221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47568159921741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.438543890978512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243133095943952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243133095943952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243133095943952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3158972562483799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243133095943952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243133095943952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6073465417308187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7944370196860258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3580472561484662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37522861303520777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42555470793258476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46929142458970724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750475092203139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5040072096298879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45387845820964035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5144558112456435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5144558112456435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5144558112456435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4823655704933512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4823655704933512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4823655704933512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4823655704933512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632372040774164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4563043441590248,0.0,0.34884434956374666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025743468613857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37114431327841785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025743468613857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4563043441590248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355339059327373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355339059327373,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355339059327373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355339059327373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.393482213717292,0.393482213717292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32306977261817804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34372208995025494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4225900201522522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326558155397022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4225900201522522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.661578085045183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.749876281387769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4911470425038596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4911470425038596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4911470425038596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41469632225730835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32303360231622696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6679922262107264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42429267000481463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42429267000481463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743320586177318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23154558076849474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41076410024798216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4292055442669541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45298070067696833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45298070067696833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48648990158725697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5382692297200402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.50119349247726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41150644681661547,0.0,0.5382692297200402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5281875752948424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5281875752948424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4037990291128319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5281875752948424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4070465501821198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3016297531730677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5467450743888571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43038860346870655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5090855248593982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3308616778485632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38187725709456694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37087281464607613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48511858272930025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45170383763191424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4096062374537004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.604787878769249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5631303675410305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5631303675410305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401668,60대 이상,그렇게 생각하셨어요? 감사해요. 제가 뭐 특별히 그런 것도 없는데 그렇게 생각해 주시니까 어 그렇네요. 저도 항상 어 잘 만나지는 못하지만 늘 통화하고 그러면서 어 좋아요. 맞아요. 그런 거 같아요. 내가 정말 힘들고 어려운 얘기를 어 남편한테도 못 하는 얘기 뭐 자식들한테도 못하는 얘기 이런 걸 할 수 있는 친구가 있다는 거는 어 정말 행운이죠. 저도 그래요. 저도 어 제가 힘들 때나 어려울 때나 어 누구한테 얘기하기 못한 그런 얘기들도 그냥 정말 기도해 주시니까 그렇게 얘기할 수 있어서 참 좋은 거 같아요. 맞아요. 늘 그런 그러면 굉장히 어 그 그게 가장 큰 자산인 거 같아요. 그 그리고 제가 며칠 전에 어떤 친구가 있는데 마음이 좀 속상했어요. 왜냐하면 그 3명이 만나는 친구가 있는데 한 친구가 약속을 해 놓고 항상 다른 일이 있다고 그 약속을 못 지키게 돼서 그 약 또 미뤄지고 미뤄지고 그런 친구가 있었어요. 근데 그 친구가 결코 저희들이 생각할 때 중요한 일은 아님에도 불구하고 쉽게 그 약속을 깨트리는 친구가 있어서 굉장히 마음이 좀 속상했던 일이 있었어요. 그래요. 결국에는 오랜 친구기 때문에 그러면서도 또 또 약속 잡아서 만나고 그렇게 해요. 그렇게 하긴 하는데 어 가 너무 그런 일들이 잦다 보니까 그 순간에 다른 모든 약속들을 취소하고 그 약속을 중요하게 생각했다가 그게 또 캔슬되고 했을 때는 순간 좀 속상할 때가 있었어요. 그래요. 그게 나이가 들어가면서 그런 것들 깨닫게 되고 그게 또 크게 중요한 일들도 아니더라고요. 겪고 보니까 그럴 수도 있었고 그냥 이렇게 받아들여지게 되고 어 저도 그렇게 생각해요. 뭐 시시비비를 가리는 게 결코 그렇게 해야 이게 어 손해 보는 거 같지 않고 그렇다 이런 거는 아닌 거 같아요. 될 수 있으면 수용하고 뭐 그럴 일이 있었겠지라고 그렇게 생각하게 하려고 노력하고 있어요. 참 잘하셨어요. 참 좋은 어 제가 어 권사님의 그런 마음을 오늘 배우게 되네요. 좋은 거 같아요. 저도 그렇게 어 뭐 그 이해하고 받아들이기보다 그 이전에 어떤 그런 것들로 품을 수 있는 그런 생각들을 해야겠어요. 근데 사 이 다르다라는 게 틀린 거 하고 다 아니잖아요. 다르다라는 거 인정하면 그런 부분이 많이 수용이 되긴 하는 거 같아요. 그렇죠. 그래서 우리가 평소에 좋은 추억을 좋은 일들을 많이 만들어야겠어요. 아이들하고도 그렇고 가족들하고도 마찬가지로 좋은 추억들을 많이 만들면 그것들이 그런 어려움이 있을 때나 그럴 때 많이 힘이 되는 거 같아요. 저도 어 그런 추억들이 부모님이 지금 다 돌아가셨지만 그런 추억들이 있기 때문에 슬픔보다는 그 추억들을 생각하면서 굉장히 마음이 따뜻해지고 그래요. 맞아요. 그거는 확실히 그런 거 같아요. 저도 누군가가 좋은 그 좋은 추억이 많고 좋은 관계가 좋은 사람들에한테는 좀 관대한 거 같아요. 그렇지만 뭔가 좀 불편하고 안 좋았던 기억이 있는 사람들하고는 작은 일에도 조금 수용이 잘 안 되게 되더라고요. 근데 아이들하고 관계는 어떠세요? 가장 중요한 게 그 그 가까이에 있는 사람인데 우리가 어 대부분 보면 가까이에 있는 사람들한테는 좀 소홀히 하고 또 약간 거리가 있는 사람들을 더 먼저 생각하는 그런 경우가 있기는 해요. 어떤 분이 어 그 조사를 했대요. 부부 관계가 참 좋은 사람 몇 가정을 방문해서 24시간 취재를 했는데 하나 발견한 게 뭐냐면 그분들은 손님을 초대했을 때 가장 맛있는 음식 좋은 것들을 초대한 그분들한테 먼저 대접하는 게 아니고 남편과 아내가 서로 먼저 챙기고 그다음 손님들한테 대접하는 그런 게 특징이었대요. 그 얘기를 들으면서 제가 아 맞구나 정말 그렇게 해야 되구나를 저는 굉장히 많이 느꼈어요. 맞아요. 맞아요. 그게 쉽지는 않아요. 그렇지만 저는 굉장히 다짐해요 항상. 매일매일 아 먼저 우선순위가 지금 현재는 남편이다. 아이들보다 남편이다. 저는 그렇게 좀 많이 노력하고 있어요. 그리고 그렇게 행동도 하려고 하고 둘이 뭉치려고 해요. 제가 가장 어 어떤 생각을 하냐면 뭔가 딱 안 맞을 때가 있기도 해요 생각이 다를 때. 그럴 때 아 이 사람은 이런 성향을 가진 사람이지. 그걸 생각하면 이해가 되더라고요. 아 그렇게 생각할 수도 있겠다라는 게 받아들여지고 그러니까 그걸 조금 그러니까 그걸 조금 조금 쉽게 할 수 있는 거 같고 지금 권사님 얘기 들으니까 권사님이 아직도 그 이전에 아이들 어렸을 때 아이들 키우면서 했던 그게 그대로 하고 있는 거 같아요. 이제 다 성인이 됐으니까 애들은 조금 이제 어 벗어나서 먼저 그 마음과 행동이 같아지기를 노력해 보세요. 너무 재밌어요. 근데 그게 제가 이해하는 건 뭔가 하면 그 경우가 어 저희 딸이 둘이잖아요. 제가 똑같이 비슷한 음식을 먹으면서 낳은 아이인데 두 아이 성격이 너무 달라요. 한 아이는 이과적인 아이고 한 아이는 문과적인 아이예요. 그러니까 이 모든 것들을 판단하고 받아들이고 어떤 것들이 확연히 달라요. 저는 왜 그럴까 왜 이게 다를까 생각했는데 제가 그걸 이제 그걸 깨닫고 그때 아 얘는 이렇게밖에 생각할 수 없는 아이 얘는 이렇게 얘 생각은 이렇구나라는 걸 둘을 구분을 했기 때문에 이제는 그런 부분이 그냥 받아들여져요. 그러니까 그걸 이해하는 게 참 중요한 거 같아요 아는 게. 성향을 알고 대하면 조금 내가 수월해지더라고요.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46767360246364265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6857160269582843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5577409182866399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한

알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히

사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고

요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5080325587877327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5080325587877327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3609068684585049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33413941927145374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33413941927145374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3609068684585049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28617149709524625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33910937875456626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30734100426548905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30734100426548905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30734100426548905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28617149709524625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22881247838512786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24998198555537068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20214205351055867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30734100426548905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20214205351055867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30734100426548905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22881247838512786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4804266757658164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4804266757658164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3781838661886203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4804266757658164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40564466099339846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.308692034301796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36560049258829697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2973685118120326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2877946099622973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36560049258829697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26564244748493504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36560049258829697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2973685118120326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36560049258829697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19951600480075316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5285031653944373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41602887696273405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38400625055232157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34760319533340606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5285031653944373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5430678536534026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8396888151739824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8777970902230432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47903263813226593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951231590259151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951231590259151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33404309552559824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951231590259151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743847149972384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243523542219137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159263246052413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.3755378803978204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29561715590155135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.349671003731692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2728628754461781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33131816266507846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3755378803978204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3755378803978204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2049390497749964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3755378803978204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39677381573184906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39677381573184906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2953943628605588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2953943628605588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706085791660343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.350053559131319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39677381573184906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39677381573184906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33824792281646077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48697344574024565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3184225891434731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5229972564829516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5229972564829516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까

알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5679818669898253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8230410674873716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까 초등학교 친구들 그분들한테보다 얘기하는 것보다 내가 늘 전화를 자주 하고 관심사가 전화를 자주 하다 보니까 관심을 갖 갖는 것들이 많아지잖아요. 그래서 제가 주로 그러한 분들이 옆에 있다는 게 그게 너무 좋아서 항상 친구는 있어야 음 나이 들수록 친구가 많아야 된다고 하지만 많은 게 아니라 정말 나의 모든 것을 얘기해 주고 또한 어 어떠한 것이라도 어떠한 것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다 있으셔서.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438453282262868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438453282262868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438453282262868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39158238444450016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438453282262868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24221588436673336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

것이라도 들어줄 수 있는 그런 사람을 그런 친구를 사귀어야 되겠다고 저는 늘 생각을 하고 있습니다. 우리 제작 교회 친구들 중에서도 보면은 누군가가 1명이 항상 이렇게 약속을 잡아 놓고 약속을 어기고 이러한 경우가 있기는 있지만 저는 그 그분이 다른 점이 또 좋기 때문에 그냥 그거를 품을 수 있더라고요. 그래서 이제는 새로운 사람을 사귀는 것보다 내가 알았던 사람들 중에서 그 한 부분이 쪼끔 나와 맞지 않아도 다른 부분에 만족을 하면서 저는 그렇게 사 그렇게 살아가려고 해요. 그러니까 성격이 다 만족할 수는 없는 거 같아요. 어느 함 어느 사람은 이쪽 면이 좋고 어느 한 분은 저쪽 면이 좋고 그러기 때문에 요즘에 저는 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 하지 않아요. 요즘에 제가 젊었을 때 옳고 그름을 밝히려고 굉장히 애쓰는 사람이었는데 어느 때부턴가 그게 그렇게 중요하지 않다는 것을 알았어요. 옳고 그름 그르다 하더라도 어느 순간에서는 그 부분이 옳을 수 있다는 것을 제가 깨달았을 때가 있었거든요. 그래서 요즘에 나는 옳고 그름을 너무 밝히지 말자. 그리고 우기지 말자. 저는 이해를 그런 사람들을 이해하려고 노력하는 것보다 그때는 저는 저한테서 그 어느 한 부분이 저도 사람들에게 배려를 하려고 노력을 많이 하는데 어떨 때는 내가 나 먼저 그러니까 내가 나를 너 먼저 생각할 때가 있더라고요. 그래서 이해하기보다는 그냥 그냥 친구니까 그냥 옛날부터 알았던 사람이고 그래서 좋은 추억을 자꾸 생각하려 그래요. 쪼끔 나쁜 일이 있다고 하더라도 예전에 좋은 추억으로 그냥 그거를 만들 좋은 추억을 기억하면서 그거를 넘으려고 해요. 제가 그 한 예로 엄마하고 아버지의 문제에 대해서 인제 제 성격이 큰딸이잖아요. 그러다 보니까 큰딸들이 가지고 있는 게 있어요. 어 그 큰딸들만이 가지고 있는 성격이 다들 그렇지는 않지만 정말 쪼끔씩 있거든요. 고런 거에서 내가 이렇게 비추어 볼 때 엄마보다는 아버지하고 제가 가까웠어요. 그러다 보니까 엄마가 하고 문제가 생기면 오래가요. 근데 아버지하고 문제가 생기면 금방 그 이튿날 풀어 주더라고요. 그래서 이 친구들도 그런 많은 추억을 가지고 있으면 그냥 어 이게 별 어 왜 저러지 이랬다가도 금방 그거를 예전에 좋았던 거를 제가 생각을 해 놓으면서 그거를 덮어 가 덮더라고요. 그래서 예 우리가 한번 이런 모임에서 그런 얘기를 했어요. 늘 불평불만을 하더라고요. 그래서 좋은 생각을 한번 그 사람과의 좋은 생각을 느껴 보라 그랬어요 기억하라고. 제가 아직도 엄마를 가장 많이 만나는 자녀 중의 1명인데 그래도 그 예전에 안 좋았던 일들이 생각이 나서 엄마가 저에게 어떠한 이렇게 별로 제가 기뻐하지 않는 얘기를 할 때 제가 반사를 하더라고요. 근데 엄마가 90이 다 돼 가는데 내가 왜 이럴까 하면서도 그래요. 그런데 예전에 아버지가 살아 계실 때는 제가 안 그런 거예요. 아버지가 나한테 어떠한 좋지 않은 얘기를 해도 아버지가 나에게 베풀어진 사랑이 있었기 때문에 덮더라고요. 아이들한테는 제가 남한테 하는 것보다 더 따뜻하게 대하지 않는 나를 발견했어요. 그래서 제가 회개했어요. 정말 내 가 가장 나를 사랑해 주고 나의 모든 것을 책임져 주고 그래도 그런 사람한테 내가 그렇게 따뜻하게 하지 못했다는 거에 대해서 요즘에 많이 회개해요. 저도 그걸 그걸 봤거든요. 그래서 나도 그렇게 해야지 그러는데 여전히 나는 우리 남편보다는 아이들 또 아이들보다는 이게 다른 사람이 누군가가 왔을 때 먼저 그러지 않나 하는 생각을 하 그렇게 또 하더라고요 내가. 그런데 안 하려고 노력하고 있어요 요즘에. 그래서 늘 남편한테 감사한 마음으로 살고 있어요. 근데 나의 행동은 예전과 지금 조금도 변하지 않았어요. 뭉칠 때는 둘이 뭉쳐요. 자식 우리 부부 그러는데 뭔가 양보해야 될 일이 있거나 이럴 때는 남편보한테 제가 양보를 하게 하더라고요 아이들보다는. 이건 분명히 잘못된 거라는 걸 알고 있는데도 제 성격이 그런 거예요. 그래서 나의 생각과 나의 행함이 다른 거예요. 생각과 행함이 똑같아야지 결과물이 맺어지는데 지금 생각과 행함이 다르기 때문에 가정의 변화는 없지만 그러나 나는 나의 마음은 남편이 우선순위로 해야 되고 아이 그것을 생각을 정말로 인제 자꾸 나를 바꾸려고 노력을 하고 있어요. 네. 내가 정말 노력할 거고 어 그 그렇지만 왜 남편이 우리는 뭐 드라마를 볼 때나 누군가 뭔가를 취미 생활이라든지 무엇을 좋아하거나 할 때 왜 다 다른지 모르겠어요. 드람 그러니까 영화배우도 그분 신랑이 좋아하면 나는 아니에요. 그리고 드라마도 그래요. 우리는 신랑은 클래식만 좋아해요. 저는 발라드만 좋아해요. 그리고 취미도 그래요. 그렇게 달라요. 그런데 어느 날 제가 깨달았어요. 어느 한 부분이 우리가 맞더라고요. 나는 그게 남편이 쪼끔 부인을 리더하면서 리드를 하면서 쪼끔 카리스마 있는 남편을 원했어요. 근데 어느 날 그런 남편 그런 남자를 제가 주위에서 봤거든요. 제가 못 찾는 거예요. 그래서 여보 감사해요. 제가 그랬더니 이분은 아직도 왜 감사한지를 모르더라고요. 요즘에 이과 문과 하니까 다행이시네요 이과 문과가 다

SD2401669,60대 이상,저는 태어나서 name1 집사님 만난 거를 너무 감사해요. 제가 언제나 힘들 때마다 어 정말 나의 모든 약점을 다 드러내면서 어 어떠한 거라도 내가 다 얘기를 할 수 있는 사람이 있다는 게 저는 너무나 감사해요. 그래서 너무 좋은 친구라고 생각해요. 우리가 친구들한테도 어떤 얘기는 나의 그 좋은 얘기 나쁜 얘기도 하지만 정말 힘든 얘기를 안 할 때가 많거든요. 70프로까지는 얘기를 해도 30프로 정도는 얘기를 안 하는데 저는 다행히 그 30프로까지도 얘기를 할 수 있는 친구가 2명 있다는 게 너무너무 저한테는 감사가 하더라고요. 어느 날 제가 그런 생각을 했습니다. 오래된 친구가 좋다고는 하는데 이렇게 살다 보면은 또 이렇게 충청도에서 서울로 올라오고 이렇게 이동을 하다 보니까
