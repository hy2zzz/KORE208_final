SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401865,60대 이상,어제 형수가 그 형 성격에 대해서 얘기하는 거 들었지만 내 성격만 별난 게 아니고 우리 형 성격도 만만치 않아요. 그래서 어 우리가 보통 이제 가까운 사람 성격에 대해선 비교적 잘 알기 때문에 그 사람 성격의 장점뿐 아니라 단점까지 속속들이 알지만 다른 부부들은 어떤 성격을 가지고 잘 살고 있는지에 대해서 다들 어 잘 모르는 거 같아. 그냥 겉 보기에 별 어 무난하면 아 각자 성격이 무난한가보다라고 이렇게 생각을 하는 거 같아. 하지만 그들도 그 속내를 들여다보면 어 여러 가지 성격적 뭐 결함도 있을 것이고 충돌도 있을 거야. 그래서 서로 간의 부부 싸움의 원인이 되기도 하겠지. name1는 어떻게 생각해? 어 물론 이제 그 name1 표현에 의하자면 그 연약한 쪽 그러니까 성격이 좀 온순한 쪽 그런 사람이 더 스트레스를 받는다라고 얘기를 하는데 아 뭐 그럴 수밖에 없겠지. 근데 인제 우리가 서로가 만났을 때 어 미리 뭐 성격 태세를 충분히 다 하고 만나는 건 쉽지 않은 일이고. 또 사실상 연애할 때와 결혼할 때는 또 다른 문제거든. 연애할 때는 서로에게 잘 보이기 위해서 잘 맞춰주지만 결혼할 때까지 그게 계속되기는 쉽지 않거든. 그러다 보면 현실적인 문제에 봉착하면 결국 각자의 성격이 드러나게 되고 그런 이제 서로 다른 성격 때문에 충돌이 발생하고 어 부부 싸움으로 이어지는데 어 부부 싸움이 그렇다고 해서 늘 늘 어느 하 일방의 승리로 끝나는 건 아닌 거 같아. 어 물론 name1 표현에 의하자면 성격이 강한 사람이 이긴다라고 하는데 난 그거에 꼭 동의하긴 어려울 거 같아. name1의 논조를 들어 보면 음 본인은 약간 성격이 유 유약하고 아니면 좋은 말로 온순하고 나는 고약하고 강한 사람인 것처럼 그렇게 표현을 하는데 뭐 그럴 수도 있겠지. 근데 그래서 이 얘기를 우리 얘기로 국한하면 내가 점점 더 불리할 거 같으니까 아 name1 친구들 중에서 어 name1 즈 즈 친구들 관계도 분명히 그런 성격 차이가 존재할 텐데. 어 한번 예를 들어보면 어떤 경우가 있을까? 어 뭐 직장 다닐 때도 우리가 보통 같이 점심 먹으러 가면 오늘 뭐 먹을까라고 얘기하면 대략 직장에서는 수평적 관계가 아니기 때문에 주로 이제 상사가 아 오늘 뭐 찌개 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 짜장면 먹을까? 아니면 뭐 탕 먹을까? 뭐 이렇게 자기가 메뉴로 선택을 하면 대부분 뭐 밑에 사람들이야 아 뭐 그러시죠 뭐. 그러고 이제 우르르 다 따라가기 마련이란 말이야. 그럴 때는 name1 말대로 이제 크게 아까 3가지 유형으로 나눴는데 어 성격이 온순하거나 뭐 그냥 남한테 저 호 그 동조를 잘하는 사람들은 별 스트레스 안 받지. 그런데 이제 자기주장이 강한 사람은 그럴 때 스트레스받거든. 아 오늘은 그건 아닌데. 그렇지만 인제 어찌 됐건 사회적 xxxx가 어 저 사람이 나보다 높으니까 거기에 대놓고 반발하기는 어렵고. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 어떤지 모르겠어. 요즘 젊은 세대들은 개성이 뚜렷하니까 그리고 또 그런 사회적 서열에도 뭐 그렇게 크게 츠 트 그 영향받지 않고. 그러니깐 아마 자기 의견을 잘 내세우지 않을까 우리 때하곤 달라서? 그 진화론 쪽 관점에서 보면 name1 말대로 하면 어 의견이 강한 사람이 생존에 유리하고 그러면 인제 당연히 그들이 인제 무성인자가 돼서 어 사람 중의 대다수가 그 의견이 강한 사람들만 살아남았어야 되는데 사실상 실제 통계를 보면 엠비티아이 같은 건 이제 그 통 엠비티아이가 정확도가 뭐 크게 어 신뢰할 만한 건 아니겠지만 어찌 됐건에 요즘 한창 유행하는 엠비티아이만 보더라도 그런 그 리더형 그리고 자기주장이 강한 형 이런 형들은 어 통계적으로 숫자가 아주 적어요. 그리고 인간이 아까도 사회적 그 동물이라고 했기 땜 했다시피 대부분 이제 리더는 굉장히 한정돼 있고 대부분의 사람들은 그 리더를 추종하는 그런 쪽이거든. 물론 또 또 한쪽에 한편의 아주 소수 사람들은 반골 기질이 있어서 그 리더에 이제 반 반하는 그런 행동을 이제 하기도 하는데. 어찌 됐거나 간에 어 name1 표현처럼 자기주장이 강한 리더형이 생존에 유리하고 그래서 더 많이 살아남고 진화론적으로 우월하다 그 유리하다. 이런 이론은 쪼금 어폐가 있지 않을까? 그런데 이제 name1 논리에도 약간의 허점이 있는데 첫째는 사실 스트레스는 만병의 근원이거든. 그렇기 땜에 스트레스를 많이 받는 사람은 생존에 절대적으로 불리하거든. 그런 건 진화론적으로 유리하다고 할 수 없고. 두 번째 리더형이 어 리스크가 많은 건 사실이야. 당연히 어 제일 먼저 어 모험심도 강하기 때문에 어 위험한 일에 뛰어들고. 그리고 무리를 이끌다가 당연히 모난 돌이 정 맞는다고 제일 먼저 어 총 맞았을 가능성이 높지. 그래 근데 이제 물론 그 양쪽이 다 일장일단이 있지만 어찌 됐거나 그건 차치하고. 지금 1가지 예로 일본 사람들의 예를 들었는데 일본 사람들은 그들의 어떤 역사적 과정이 좀 독특해 사실은. 오랜 시 시기 동안 역사적으로 무신 정권 소위 이제 그 무사들이 이제 그 집권하는 그런 무신 정 오랜 무신 정권이 계속돼 왔고. 또 그들이 사법권도 가지고 있었기 때문에 어 일반 양민들은 쉽게 자기 의견을 표현할 수가 없었어. 그 자기 의견이 예를 들어서 상대 그 지배 계급에 마음에 안 들면 즉참을 하는 즉결 츠 참할 수 있는 그런 권한을 그 지배 계급들 다 갖고 있었기 때문에 그래서 일본 사람들은 자기 의사를 겉으로 드러내는 거를 굉장히 두려워해. 어 사실 이제 인간의 어떤 특서 특성을 이제 규정하는 데서 어 대부분은 사실 유전자가 결정을 해. 그래서 유전자 결정론 이런 것들이 인제 어 설득력을 갖게 되는데 그렇다고 해서 유전자가 모든 걸 결정하진 않거든. 그 외에는 이제 예를 들어서 가장 어 크게 영향을 주는 것이 인제 역사적이라든가 그다음에 환경적 이런 요인들이 인제 작용을 하게 되는데 그런 면에서 보자면 저 서양 애들과 동양 애들을 비교하면 첫 번째 동양은 어 농경 사회가 주를 이뤘고 또 농경 사회에 필수적으로 수반하는 전체주의 즉 전체적인 공익을 개인적인 사익보다 항상 앞세우는 그런 이제 경향이 늘 있어 왔기 때문에 사실은 이제 뭐 동양 사회를 아주 대표하는 한중일 이 3개국을 또 어 돌아보더라도 거의 비슷한 성 공통점을 갖고 있고. 반대로 이제 서양 애들은 유목 민족 그런 그런 이제 경제를 주로 해 왔기 때문에 아무래도 개인적으로 어 개인주의적인 성향이 강화될 수밖엔 없었고. 그렇기 때문에 걔네들 간에는 서로 각 상대의 어떤 개인주의적 성향을 오히려 지지하고 보호하고 그런 쪽으로 인제 역사가 발전해 왔지. 그러니까 인제 똑같은 상황에서도 대처하는 방식이 서로 다를 수밖에 없는 거지. 어 지 진화와 환경을 이렇게 으 비교 분석해 보면 사실 이제 어 단기간의 환경은 가지고 있는 유전자하고는 관계가 없어요. 그런데 그 환경이 지속적으로 계속되면 거기에 순응하는 자만이 살아남거든. 그래서 결국 그 유전자를 이제 후대에 더 많이 남기게 되고. 그래서 그렇게 진화의 방향이 결정되는 거지. 그렇게 보자면 결국 단기간의 환경은 유전자가 차지하는 효과나 영향력을 상당 부분 잠식할 수 있지만 장기간에 걸쳐 보면 결국 그것이 유 유전자에 반영이 된다는 거지. 어떤 특정 환경이 장기간 지속되면 그게 어 특정 유전자를 이제 고착화시키는 그런 이제 결과를 낳게 되거든. 그래서 어 name1 말대로 단기간적으론 분명히 영향력이 있어요. 그러니까 유전자 아까 얘기했다시피 유전자가 모든 것을 결정하지 않거든. 그렇기 때문에 어 유전자 이외에도 그 사람의 여러 가지 역사적 배경이나 환경적 역량 이런 것들을 무시할 순 없지만 결국 장기적으로 보면 어 유전자가 갖고 있는 영향력이 생각보다 굉장히 크다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.408325523700285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632542422895144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5993250510219104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5093871385432108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5311847850122898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5311847850122898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.435611358282156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4959114768569791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는 거죠.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5901168988273161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5901168988273161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5509302055949212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는

SD2401866,60대 이상,어 어제 그 내용에 대해선 내가 들은 바가 없긴 한데 음 글쎄. 내 생각에는 성격을 크게 나누면 자기 개성과 주관이 강한 사람하고 좀 그것을 덜 내세우는 그 2가지로 크게는 분리하고 싶어. 근데 그중에서 어 만약에 늘 같이 생활을 하는 부부라면은 내가 보기에는 강한 쪽이 어 쪼끔 더 목소리를 크게 낼 테니까 그 연약한 성격을 가진 사람들 쪽이 쪼금 더 피해 의식이 생기고 좀 생활할 때 평생을 두고 봤을 때 어려움을 느끼지 않을까 싶네. 어 어떤 두 성격이 충돌을 한다면 내가 생각하기에는 아까 말한 대로 여린 쪽이 쪼금 더 어려울 수 있어. 왜냐하면은 그 목소리를 적게 내는 사람들 온순한 쪽은 어떤 일이 있냐면은 강한 사람하고 부딪히는 게 싫기 때문에 자기의 감정을 웬만한 건 지나가려고 하지. 그리고 인제 그중에서 정 안 되는 것들 자기가 정말 참기 힘든 것들만 이야기를 하는데 성격이 강한 쪽에 늘 자기 생각을 자유롭게 개진하는 그런 약간 활발한 쪽에서는 어떤 생각을 하냐면은 저 사람이 말을 안 하면은 자기처럼 생각을 하는 거야. 아 나 같으면 불편한 말을 했을 텐데. 쟤가 표현을 안 하면 아 불편함이 없나 보다 해서 뭐 오케이 하는 걸로 생각을 하고 행동을 한다는 거지. 근데 성격이 여린 사람들은 그래. 어 강한 사람들한테 이렇게 얘기를 해 봐야 잘 안 통하겠다 싶은 거는 미리 거른다는 거지. 그래서 인제 그런 것들이 계속 축적을 하게 되면 어 본인의 스트레스로 다가오는 거야. 그래서 아마 화를 내도 조용한 사람들이 온순한 사람들이 화가 난 거는 정말 크게 화가 난 거지. 근데 음 강성인 사람들은 그런 거를 잘 못 느끼는 거 같아. 스스로 마음이 찔리시는군요. 그런 건 아니고. 어 우리 둘을 특정해서 생각하는 건 아니고 대부분의 인간관계가 사실 그런 거 같아. 보면은 친구들 관계에서도 어떤 똑같은 일 예를 들면 식사하러 갔을 때도 나 이거 오늘 먹고 싶어라고 말하고 분명히 의견을 생각하는 친구가 있고. 아니면 글쎄 뭐가 좋을까 하는 친구가 있고. 그래? 그러면 난 너희들이 먹는 거 따라서 먹지. 이런 친구들이 있다는 거지. 최근에 들은 바에 의하면 요즘 어 엠제트 세대들도 그런 눈치는 본다고 합니다. 그런데 다만 어 그걸 인제 은근한 식으로 다른 식으로 불만들을 표현들 하고 한다는데요. 에스엔에스에다가 뭐 상사 일을 폭로한다든가 뭐 뭐 오늘도 짜장면이다 뭐 이렇게 해서 뭐 사회 그 에스엔에스에 돌린다든가 이런 우회적인 거라도 그들은 표현을 불만을 표현을 하는 그 타입들이라고 해. 하지만 어 어쨌건 개성이 강한 친구들이 조금 더 자기가 원하는 방향으로 무엇 무엇인가 다가가려고 하는 그 어 성향들이 있기 때문에 좀 더 나는 유리하다고 봐. 스트레스를 아까 많이 받을 수도 있다고 말을 했는데 음 나는 좀 더 그것이 어 아 쟤는 저거를 싫어한다. 난 이걸 먹을 수 없어. 난 이거 싫어해라고 말을 주장하는 얘기를 들으면 주변에서도 굳이 쟤가 먹고 싶어 하자는 걸 내가 먹으러 가려고 할까? 그런 면에서 유리하다는 거지 의견을 표진 표현하는 쪽이. 어 그거는 내용을 좀 잘못 이해한 거 같은데 생존에 유리하다는 게 아니라 생존에 유리한 거하고 스트레스 지수하고는 좀 다른 거야. 생존에 유리하다는 건 좀 더 마 좀 멀리 나간 거지 그 내용에서. 생존에 그 사람들이 통계적으로 적다는 것은 강성인 사람들이 적다는 것은 내가 보기에 그 지금까지 흘러온 그 지구 그 인류 역사 관점에서 보통 그 용감한 사람들이 어떤 그 많은 그 용감한 일에 나섰다가 실제로 어 불이익을 당하는 일이 많아서였지 않을까라는 생각을 한번 해보고. 그거는 너무나 다양한 변수가 있기 때문에 그 음 생존에 유리하다 아니다 성격 가지고 그거를 평가할 순 없어. 근데 분명히 스트레스 지수는 음 그쪽이 쪼끔 더 낫지 않을까. 현대 생활을 현대인의 생활 중에서는 그렇지 않을까 하는 생각이고. 또 어 성격도 이런 흔한 얘기가 있어. 일본 사람들 얘긴데 일본 사람들이 굉장히 예의 바르고 조용하고 뭐 어 친절하다고 해. 그리고 타인들에게 그 피해를 주지 않는 성격을 갖췄다고들 평가들을 하지. 그런 역사적 배경이 있어서 그런지 모르겠지만 지금도 그게 이어지는 거 같고. 그 문화에 따라서 예를 들면은 일본 정치도 그런 음 분위기로 간다고 보아 지는데 그러니까 극우적인 어떤 혹은 다른 어떤 강성을 가진 사람들이 여러 조용한 사람들을 그냥 늑대개가 마치 양 떼들을 몰고 가는 그런 형국이라고들 얘기를 해. 그래서 국가 간 인종 간에도 성격이 과연 있는 것인가라는 생각을 한번 해보게 됐고. 그 그 큰 것이 큰 내용이 드러나게 된 최근에 드러나게 된 사건이 있는데 그게 뭐냐 하면 코로나지. 코로나 사건 때 그 동양권 특히 우리 한국 같은 경우에는 마스크 수칙이라든가 기타 등등 어 예방 접종이라든가 이런 어떤 전체적인 내용에 대한 사회 공익에 대한 혹은 나 자신을 지키기 위한 거에 대해서 굉장히 룰을 잘 지켰다는 거야. 그래서 어 사망률도 떨어지고 뭐 여러 가지 빨리 종식도 되는 데 기여도 했겠지. 근데 그렇게 시체가 음 쌓이고 예를 들면은 그 음 옆집 앞집 다 죽어 나가는 상황에도 서양인들은 희한하게 난 마스크를 거부한다. 그냥 다니겠다라고 하는 사람들이 많았다는 점이야. 음 그 점을 이제 역사적으로 생각을 해봐 해본 거 같은데 그 아까 유전자 얘기가 나왔잖아. 근데 유전자를 생각을 해 보면은 그 정말 환경적인 것과 유전적인 것이 어느 것이 더 큰 영향을 미칠까라는 생각을 가끔 해 보게 돼 성격에. 근데 아까 예를 들면 뭐 팥 심은 데 팥 나고 콩 심은 데 팥 콩 심은 데 콩 난다라는 그 격언이 있듯이 그 얘기는 뭐냐면은 결국 자기가 받아온 그런 어떤 어 생물학적 특성을 벗어날 수 없다라는 풀이가 되겠지. 그래서 내 생각에는 음 최근에는 교육론 교육하는 분들은 환경에 대한 이야기를 많이 해. 예를 들어서 어 수박이 수박씨가 호박이 돼서 나올 수는 없지마는 어 자랄 순 없지만 그 같은 수박 중에서도 크고 다른 열매가 맺히느냐 아니면은 정말 찌그러져서 어 상품 가치가 없는 그러니까 생존에 아주 유리하지 못한 그런 어 수박이 되느냐라는 것은 환경이라는 거지. 그래서 성격도 내가 보기에 기존의 수박이라는 성격을 타고 나도 환경이 다르면 굉장한 변화를 겪을 수 있다는
