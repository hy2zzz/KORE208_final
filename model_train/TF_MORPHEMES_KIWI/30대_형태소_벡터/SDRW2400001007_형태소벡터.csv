SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어? 그러면 고등학교 때랑 중학교 때에는 공부하는 게 좀 다르잖아. 근데 어떤 부분에서 차이가 있었고 어떤 시절이 좀 더 좋았는지 너의 개인적인 생각이 궁금해. 그러면 난 너의 고등학교 시절에 대한 기억이 별로 없단 말이야 난 대학교를 다니고 있었으니까. 그런데 난 고등학교 시절을 생각하면 수학여행이 되게 큰 그 추억의 부분을 차지하는데. 너 같은 경우에는 수학여행을 어디로 갔었는지 그 장소나 혹은 또 같이 가서 있었던 에피소드 같은 게 기억나는 게 있는지 없으면 소풍이라도 기억나는 게 있어? 나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2756047155569344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.461160499595248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3706107695673064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3706107695673064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4277412884197976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3007748562950021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040299807427569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337107362163569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5644437921262875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7023519081064434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2449830217732782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1881482398082945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430423333891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20498544958437412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21226229192355076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17226471973464672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26412342173159614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31227732232359307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31227732232359307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31227732232359307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26113689568685117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4847151145615245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31227732232359307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2896473230300805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31227732232359307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20367131796522714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2896473230300805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42565536657255787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4589116057259107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4589116057259107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3561600148994267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993080985588857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42565536657255787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.707690187245049,0.5174492553139765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4810622278376039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29569042992830336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742624435135807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20099967405979274,0.0,0.29569042992830336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29569042992830336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376310587866867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5913808598566067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38570626342694364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25905904520140943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757400290726367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20349096704061326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757400290726367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757400290726367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3485110374532996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32919176044726584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3485110374532996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31420656500839494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.291610786659313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3384137750519812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719655948726543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3384137750519812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24744154863914194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3384137750519812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22520017859603642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3138897288184688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3384137750519812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26264198521201104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719655948726543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3384137750519812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21217420228959458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20306335906987272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4904636185510497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6102964779689662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20742875104437025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3051482389844831,0.0,0.0,0.3051482389844831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2673451807533286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21461023022763004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24968795218151807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23896625387121043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22174880278291176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591003905358793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591003905358793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2441034749415374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.333077234183507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591003905358793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591003905358793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31461351091489453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4722493368326783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951467408878541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5091459393874183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3722775755981033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4722493368326783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2058262564376192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12723217588415267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1596972243325619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404021720253383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450723645453265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21790558204962915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1596972243325619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17177654994457192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4698608705923056,0.2349304352961528,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3291007596353646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4945477003393398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4945477003393398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3974423307533276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4945477003393398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42631951447332356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34261087729584666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34261087729584666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28369776255006474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3735052446471356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42631951447332356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42631951447332356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2818009467711593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4234691233576531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3286532033678599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35411925358530905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4234691233576531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28785901454407214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3286532033678599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3710079720737377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594866042925372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38058379481410404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38058379481410404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24521992932414113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38058379481410404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.300016964334076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41031861479333465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34312235199272095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22071156026525326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27119901504206056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6325771865923597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35704988841239604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4075373431892033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3275166206111085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27702916583430115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879395861382882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2670732850492467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720821878822556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879395861382882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879395861382882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17780615165772964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44693821646514637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25226840881783263,0.2879395861382882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2670732850492467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879395861382882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879395861382882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18779793091211758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3909191805794661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4461958102365982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41386105472092494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4461958102365982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3262496695481196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41386105472092494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48304680725598903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48304680725598903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48304680725598903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44804154710581695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31504938988420855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2891387605758713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3667843482519806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39544102442969126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39544102442969126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39544102442969126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39544102442969126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39544102442969126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715632643034045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2646829792594146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255324310147558,0.0,0.2986061196639491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3446369529525979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715632643034045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715632643034045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525752863753004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715632643034045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.31164719999499824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.227870351270334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31164719999499824,0.0,0.2730390229063988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24186852110224635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2730390229063988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31164719999499824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.260609966009192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118465099997669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24186852110224635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31164719999499824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31164719999499824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28906286417696586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21140356607075372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13691221281268418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.0,0.0,0.15108420430692715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.4429717251630432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962007388446179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848455974191133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25280433608814573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2214858625815216,0.0,0.0,0.17184725649369328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23448420350694155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4060348123833391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6461949129840109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6461949129840109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3641941684379425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34022047043114717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5112575596802474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44792080452141086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4108711778361341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3475344226772974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35757959405133083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087859768207359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3855171074248473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3377576128605387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3223824897626674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3855171074248473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30982009948702216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3855171074248473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620606049227135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3655228890450731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4371060195793186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4371060195793186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4371060195793186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4371060195793186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3196033919942659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4460566516381146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6086407243992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6561935172890775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19276033712110527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2860394540543753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3559262395145039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31183258718624374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976376016955812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5952752033911624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2321397076192658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677389348579835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976376016955812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32180253441304185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734034032528028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734034032528028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734034032528028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734034032528028
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6250484078175526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226866928951914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5797526273808772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602564682690839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602564682690839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4269027701066188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4269027701066188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602564682690839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35374942961319283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39237111646509637,0.0,0.0,0.42302687394115535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42302687394115535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39237111646509637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31821414684064625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3283099748314625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484310600077127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20817786541425173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44888539413052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18768660091965386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803729520549226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803729520549226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444269706526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36651656775838143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45606597912609936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45606597912609936,0.0,0.381377850723219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4230159558050848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35395153204664753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3410290227972456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5427397183457143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5427397183457143,0.0,0.0,0.5427397183457143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24653127093202104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015032082213308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28195202131222286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22919519394077023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25362902213007166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33716883249117596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20820580236367106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33716883249117596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33716883249117596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29539892731062384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26167578876922554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25362902213007166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31273500430187456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337347536162916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337347536162916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43906921870510307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337347536162916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3673838315139217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24973287945365202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24973287945365202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49946575890730405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24973287945365202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20069735964335625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21879491102349383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21879491102349383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20883510978708758,0.20883510978708758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23163532807351447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24973287945365202,0.0,0.24973287945365202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878569425933356,0.23163532807351447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878569425933356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19381698993294277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547116245806461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2360457141361393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850633310434928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24112015036542417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547116245806461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3107684439025775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21903868711075924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547116245806461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547116245806461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850633310434928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2752907006912721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3228224733936324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3228224733936324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34804443045646083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34804443045646083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34804443045646083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34804443045646083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34804443045646083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544832959419174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34804443045646083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3831112081315078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2972497173500257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4372837773515461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4372837773515461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4372837773515461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4372837773515461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22852515090392175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42196490632103034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42196490632103034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42196490632103034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3913861071278026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3913861071278026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.327485784728865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4858018654335868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3560313084024393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4858018654335868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4064865927198448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4858018654335868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359505739721694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359505739721694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3116050300976536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359505739721694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359505739721694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359505739721694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359505739721694,0.3359505739721694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359505739721694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37145492119437784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43262945361512567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49380398603587344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43262945361512567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49380398603587344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5100658544855572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4048055606825675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48684705792219307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5821900242368425,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4009093781679039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4009093781679039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27252371461194025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30157666945731615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37185642332252805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35124302381261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30157666945731615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4009093781679039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3247603511720478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3247603511720478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17588170757200242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22076035652879675,0.0,0.0,0.3247603511720478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30122573628903465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3247603511720478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520456010895976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48858994282361984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3247603511720478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45042677653912955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28302443740999084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45042677653912955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30618385347851973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3388252171197038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619846331882326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177854128979455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868399639709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25130501250902415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868399639709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23051839843882843,0.25130501250902415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868399639709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868399639709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.266053349900793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25130501250902415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868399639709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868399639709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23051839843882843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.239865313282959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868399639709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951921187292784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35629275632613316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835305763351344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951921187292784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4260682796897459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4260682796897459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3424089729337742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38921741407769744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38921741407769744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27816277843036785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4654408238644637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4654408238644637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43171142770834414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226866928951914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6250484078175526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5797526273808772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22091613016636594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021362499169575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526565867502315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021362499169575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021362499169575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802411501662295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021362499169575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802411501662295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.604272499833915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48296903239839434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28199920487909375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38072798932048074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5207031593622712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5207031593622712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40282909319106663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40282909319106663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2945407722861995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35292491639560614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40282909319106663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3736370211363633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40282909319106663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6414966560967504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7671258307583492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649983494681202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649983494681202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649983494681202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649983494681202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649983494681202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649983494681202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385477819753018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.293330238183675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45798479425058125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4012476952469772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45798479425058125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45798479425058125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45798479425058125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38891341700404713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5318979708159064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5318979708159064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5318979708159064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6800419095128621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7331732409915818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484310600077127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484310600077127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13874565570006167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44162093582934264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11958517105442737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16610059310493155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19345553050980147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19345553050980147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048088553232479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048088553232479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081046791467132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3910512471786376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5335862910819537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48106457942209685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5752751189429954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484310600077127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3608542464938621,0.0,0.0,0.24529568287328496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21565839235958179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3608542464938621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3608542464938621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3608542464938621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3608542464938621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3608542464938621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3347039923465082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3681559903606281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42490809924432765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42490809924432765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830837476006668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830837476006668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45810595477813587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066173007063855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41934557393035343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370062830736284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41934557393035343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38895659156311047,0.0,0.41934557393035343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370062830736284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467058463437875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36292873663824937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36292873663824937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5633359567973584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33662814909443695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33662814909443695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36292873663824937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5619970495483257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699610071337269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4923744711565405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699610071337269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23463144362898986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25788587443513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22858875642343487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2811403052412703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32089401727831807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32089401727831807,0.2811403052412703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2811403052412703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976395864721778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976395864721778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32089401727831807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32089401727831807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.332463706464447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3983649696366194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.332463706464447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4546944463901956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4546944463901956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4546944463901956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5266371508237958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.601104529750107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.601104529750107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4901419031824255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.358382195162613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294210451194814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4901419031824255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4546224782039913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.285109774266325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23794424592174493,0.0,0.30184201172784325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30184201172784325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32542477590013325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32542477590013325,0.0,0.32542477590013325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2721312425949721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30184201172784325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30184201172784325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32542477590013325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7427146205033517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6696080887284458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4188803764654912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503367203164139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25866366185752554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4188803764654912,0.38852510585875283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4188803764654912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31509502075699486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3062771573977663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484310600077127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912797021794408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831779275567028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2190510558676008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601658575706403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4381021117352016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2190510558676008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2190510558676008,0.2190510558676008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2190510558676008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20317694370779998,0.0,0.1760399697304411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4381021117352016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4381021117352016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16477710791288303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601658575706403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7677538891194383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6407448522945599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7899951805237938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6131130521764957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14618251063699597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22687672566833253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2446024898420812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2446024898420812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2446024898420812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.409089807734718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204544903867359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2446024898420812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4892049796841624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4892049796841624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33494507506951304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29345065839114876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33494507506951304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106723973233714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33494507506951304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106723973233714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33494507506951304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33494507506951304,0.0,0.33494507506951304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21845552016959774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44590883678039916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5548558186359974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5548558186359974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4306220504487728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39044620490952275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39044620490952275,0.36215149149417847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39044620490952275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39044620490952275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39044620490952275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3265043683739878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2724393416630869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2724393416630869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32579321235469183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28543256725004945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021837484635611,0.32579321235469183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32579321235469183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021837484635611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32579321235469183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32579321235469183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.238213639467788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322657301756743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26510849509176987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26510849509176987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2130539442797579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938421583838416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26510849509176987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24589670919585352,0.0,0.26510849509176987,0.26510849509176987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26510849509176987,0.26510849509176987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26510849509176987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24589670919585352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26510849509176987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2216927214354021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24589670919585352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400643,30대,나는 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다녀본 적이 있는데. 사실 주기적으로 재택근무를 할 수 있게끔 제도화되어 있던 건 아니고 그런 제도가 있지만 악천후나 자연재해 때 대표의 그 재량으로 이날 그냥 재택근무 하세요라고 갑자기 지시가 내려와서 하는 경우가 많았고 또 집에 재택근무 할 수 있는 환경이 주어진 게 아니라 재택근무 하는 게 썩 선호되지 않는 편이었는데 일반적으로 사람들은 재택근무 하는 걸 훨씬 더 선호하더라고. 근데 너 같은 경 너 같으면 어 재택근무를 하는 회사에 다니는 게 좋은지 안 하는 게 더 규칙적인 생활에 도움이 돼서 좋은지 아니면 꼭 그런 재택근무 관련해서 생각해 놓은 게 있는지 좀 알고 싶어. 그러면 재택근무 말고도 회사에서는 되게 복지 제도가 여러 가지가 있잖아 다양하게. 뭐 현금성 복지 제도도 있고 휴가를 많이 주는 형태의 제도도 있고 나는 사실 휴가를 많이 주는 제도보다는 현금성을 더 좋아하거든 뭐 복지 포인트를 준다든지 생일 때 상품권을 준다든지 이런 식으로. 근데 사실 나는 돈 벌려고 회사 다닌다고 생각해서 그런 걸 좋아하는 거고 휴식을 더 중요하게 생각하거나 체력적으로 일하는 게 힘들다고 생각하는 경우에는 휴식을 주는 복지 제도를 더 선호할 수도 있는데 너는 일을 다닐 때 현금성으로 나오는 복지 제도랑 휴가를 주는 식의 복지 제도 중에 어떤 게 더 좋았어? 나는 이런 것들은 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 제도는 생일 때 생일 선물 주는 그런 복지 제도가 있었는데. 생일 선물은 사실 나는 친구들한테도 난 생일 선물 갖고 싶은 게 딱히 없는데 하는 경우가 많았어서 회사 사람들은 내 친구들보다도 훨씬 날 잘 모르기 때문에 그 더 나에게 필요로 하는 선물이나 물건 서비스 같은 거를 제공해 주기가 어렵단 말이지. 그런데 그렇게 선물을 주는 것보다는 그냥 상품권을 퉁쳐서 주거나 아니면 되게 특이했던 제도 중에 생일 때 미역 미역을 하마 1보따리 주는 회사가 있었어. 그 난 미역을 좋아하니까 미역국 끓여 먹기에 그런 차라리 미역을 주는 게 낫지 생일 선물이랍시고 어쭙잖게 막 립밤 주고 이런 거는 나는 썩 좋지 않았던 것 같아. 그래서 그냥 선물 주는 제도가 좀 별로였고 미역을 선물해 주는 제도가 굉장히 좋았다 그런 생각이 들고. 그리고 회사 다니면은 야근을 하기도 하잖아. 근데 야근하다 보면 회 학교 다닐 때 야자 하는 생 야자 했던 그런 생각이 떠오른단 말이야. 근데 난 야근도 야자도 몸이 힘들지만 야자가 좀 더 좋았던 것 같거든. 왜냐하면 그땐 체력이 좀 더 강했고 학생이니까. 그리고 난 학원을 다니지 않았으니까 학원 다니는 대신에 학교에서 좀 더 남아서 공부하고 선생님들 중에도 남아 계시는 분들 야자 감독 분들이 있으니까 질문도 어느 때나 하 아무 때나 하고 답변 받을 수 있고 해서 야근보다 여자가 좋았는데 너는 야근이랑 야자 중에 뭐가 더 좋았는지 물어본다면 뭐라고 대답을 할 것 같아? 나는 학원은 사실 어 아주 어릴 때 초등학교 때 다녔던 학원 말고는 크게 도움이 안 됐던 것 같은 게 체력이 약한 편인데 학원을 가자니 나 학교 다닐 때는 야자가 필수였으니까 학교에서 야자 끝나고 학원을 갔다가 학원 끝나고 집에 가면 너무너무 피곤했단 말이야. 그래서 학원을 다닐 때는 사실 이게 공부에 도움이 되나 싶기도 하고 사 그 학원에서 배운 내용들이나 이런 것들은 굉장히 스파르타식이어서 따라가기도 벅찼거든. 근데 학교에서는 내 속도에 맞춰서 공부를 하다가 모르는 게 있으면 쪼끔 소화시키는 그런 시간도 있었고. 근데 학원은 그게 없으니까 쪼끔 쉽지 않고 선생님 진도나 친구들 진도를 맞춰 가다 보면 너무 내가 벅찬 느낌이 들어서 좀 많이 힘들다는 생각이 들어서 제 학원 다니면서 그나마 도움이 됐던 건 초등학교 때 뭐 영어 학원이라든지 뭐 전 과목 한꺼번에 가르치는 보습 학원 그런 학원 정도만 크게 도움이 됐고 나머지는 차라리 인터넷 강의가 도움이 됐던 것 같아. 너는 인터넷 강의 들어본 경험이 있는지 없는지 잘 모르겠어 그때 너무 우리가 생활 패턴이 달랐으니까. 그래서 그 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금해. 나는 일단 국어 과목은 무조건 좋아했어. 국어 선생님이 별로여도 막 국어 시간에 짧게 짧게 단편 소설 같은 게 교과서에 실려 있거든. 그런 거 읽는 거를 되게 좋아해서 공부 시간에 딴짓하는 기분이 들어서 되게 좋았고. 싫어하는 과목은 과학을 별로 안 좋아했어. 왜냐하면 수학은 그래도 공식에 넣어서 맞출 수는 있는데 과학은 너무 약간 세상 전체가 문제와 숙제 같은 느낌이어서 그게 좀 어려웠는데. 나중에 다 자라고 보니깐 오히려 과학을 좀 어려워했던 게 성인이 되고 나서 과학 관련 교양 도서를 읽고 그런 거에 대한 욕심을 부리게 된 부분이 좀 긍정이었던 것 같아 내가 과학 쪽 진로를 선택하지 않았으니까. 근데 특이하게 또 좋아했던 선생님은 국사 선생님이었어 가지고. 근데 또 선생님을 좋아하면 성적이 잘 나온다고 하는데 나는 꼭 그렇지도 않아서 너는 학창 시절에 좋아했던 선생님이 있어?

나는 사실 회사 생활하는 것보다 학교 생활이 더 재밌었는데. 네가 생활하는 걸 지켜보면 학교 생활에서 재미를 찾는 것만큼이나 회사 생활에서도 되게 재미를 찾는 것 같아서 부러울 때도 있고 신기할 때도 있거든. 회사 생활 할 때 어떤 마음가짐으로 해? 나는 엄청 열심히 해야 한다 열심히 해야 한다 이렇게 생각하다 보니깐 부담감이 커서 사람들과 뭐 친하게 지내거나 관계를 좀 친밀하게 가져가거나 하는 거에는 등한시했던 것 같은데. 너는 그 부분에 대해서 쪼끔 더 이렇게 신경 쓰고 좀 관계 개선이나 관계를 유지하는데 많은 노력을 기울이는 것 같아서 너의 그 퇴사 회사 사람들과 친해지는 노하우가 궁금해. 그러면 회식 가서 여러 가지 먹어 보 이렇게 되게 색다른 걸 먹는 경우도 많잖아 우리는 늘 비슷한 걸 먹고 사니까. 먹었던 것 중에 이거 되게 맛있어서 나한테도 추천해 주고 싶은 게 있으면 1가지만 얘기해 줘.,0.3067836398669396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067836398669396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22431421101037685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067836398669396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067836398669396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845517547534379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067836398669396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067836398669396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845517547534379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687779812373802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23809392567676432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067836398669396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41361259342617135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24718851953286533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3623725108798536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836390666027188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836390666027188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41361259342617135,0.41361259342617135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4001625374098985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6480238975738748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6480238975738748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43089654792353776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49182604456476037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3952550772006068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4561845738418294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4561845738418294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373981054824151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41707316805113864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49845413524175813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373981054824151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3305246214799535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065107769364588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46399208454342045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46399208454342045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36010296031367106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065107769364588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7521606433172547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.658979792288484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4827088831898603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4827088831898603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879280875811866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4827088831898603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879280875811866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6414966560967504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7671258307583492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457759362100079,0.3615607467221553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33535929417349525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615607467221553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30234936785901256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33535929417349525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615607467221553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615607467221553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3167690677404117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31566911121622576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41964355967006917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41964355967006917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3509201873892924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41964355967006917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3372457587538158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3676563354431475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3034096709294878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3880570859613552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4828693991875875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3880570859613552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37475359146145526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4828693991875875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.559632879415812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.559632879415812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49030318444844095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649998190044106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38876581156420903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3697625072968811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5738751275024156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6187117018373195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38925978327682953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6513358661716993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6513358661716993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44600338455340005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27541244501086515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35842978252481306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44600338455340005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44600338455340005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44600338455340005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17193948727220024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174811584314542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2944740494376016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781502458251096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4307819802234382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4307819802234382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47670638514157376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6337229626538713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4735134767510645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3673913582746633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40655787469226773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5013025623922568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4735134767510645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4060348123833391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6461949129840109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6461949129840109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42863480988242814,0.42863480988242814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2852384945712505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42863480988242814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42863480988242814,0.0,0.0,0.42863480988242814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43625186089912243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38210195271055686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228367225056819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5621098203364185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41100373183080025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6315162699850111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4498604244523373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6315162699850111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714373733927643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714373733927643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28827150760877246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714373733927643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714373733927643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29850494767000163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714373733927643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714373733927643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44191364143414014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5295101718741887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.327318450456116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4021920793913532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5054062471537645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43639247505993317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43639247505993317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43639247505993317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30343031173688473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43639247505993317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38233032414852913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39305848245766756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5652954150201734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5652954150201734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45429859881185525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3428130078870553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4099486894760417,0.0,0.4099486894760417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850435462407071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591625068927093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4099486894760417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4099486894760417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5534127141638187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4627824945310024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4162944851416288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5534127141638187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4475936932933896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5892841396186904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6726099081323755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34487569778871924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3735513058059938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34487569778871924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34487569778871924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28839676364670364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30215103344392524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34487569778871924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34487569778871924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30215103344392524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3929402443863015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3253728224513109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4535129041231556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4088729379499575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4889456386381575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35750750987129964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4754570502166329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5426874768325373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4754570502166329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5033601983547477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34899644480356035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5244454294041663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.459474905003281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5244454294041663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342050107938677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3230471684241602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30834168202853285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3230471684241602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342005837755135,0.30834168202853285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3230471684241602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342005837755135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696056811298198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30834168202853285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30834168202853285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5416308186174138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8406164739783716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8323992601445821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5541763904306571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6198963465285801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4810998224080294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6198963465285801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5940339421848317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8044399763390354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4945558877828651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5910555898990418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6372344650977361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151320775546586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44238395589525886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44238395589525886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44238395589525886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34333295204790837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44238395589525886,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015579434890132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45218883088451656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.540744412702931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015579434890132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3808513217344454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5621921843909893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5068547510657514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5310277580926339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3611430502038115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6042890417197402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3731557388066857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6042890417197402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24822557185262617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38328042474480906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4015599029999529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45834114870495896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45834114870495896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45834114870495896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27183871505100304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878937727562495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40127365272247406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081802603898385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37902954559514307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43262496086721297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37902954559514307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.335759023275516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5781196035749604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5362246426372904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43487978602761057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43487978602761057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.434317524128934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.414546880499349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4957307525596565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4957307525596565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847352518759421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3470713219424323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3470713219424323,0.3470713219424323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3470713219424323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902328190839972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26936108316251517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3470713219424323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3470713219424323,0.3470713219424323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28847568772975235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3718027731968286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39362276272889263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39362276272889263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3293572689265705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42437631069639864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42437631069639864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30252946923031676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28060587380556007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30252946923031676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6050589384606335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30252946923031676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28060587380556007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2529854100860111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24312723987991744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28060587380556007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3707747042562317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3707747042562317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30829325062357543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44338633775176717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34411089780585924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44338633775176717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34411089780585924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45844737573452726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5084997843081793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4803117295987943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5482286160448715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43060780907712354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47762074695336515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5149370150722978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4138281652529514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3873518516714705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4945558877828651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5910555898990418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6372344650977361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.502165886167922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36027890328088685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.502165886167922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4350949757753807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42017891361194354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29087205842560615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3297581313570915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3146736321887566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46291608195003947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40556807410856177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33847520595190705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46291608195003947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37285099343244466,0.0,0.41355815252670763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35832197947263367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41355815252670763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37285099343244466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37285099343244466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3353968963385374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6802601047691286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7329707974124852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634747696888918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.1953726137307664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17614178967081345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11407547488837631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4753433190072238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15844777300240795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1845423752636037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.1953726137307664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.3522835793416269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106369775247994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34000741444060795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2843257398804232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34000741444060795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315367880928127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34000741444060795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315367880928127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34000741444060795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29788585368738923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315367880928127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26387880428852967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43041292424779737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31470953129439744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25722895101262244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3992219171673885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3459005383748063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43041292424779737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43041292424779737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45359445201257986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45359445201257986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45359445201257986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45359445201257986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42072353441854116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3419143439077251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296594941997759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4129168036902897,0.5138029844718388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5138029844718388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4050621423554701,0.35488132595731714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35488132595731714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33872671133436716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757082465069773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4050621423554701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4050621423554701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5278314573298244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5687310507643827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6308240202699281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30134601609065703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2375532489654393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248900283739198,0.0,0.0,0.21620069219298088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2443925186900098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2716840685641057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22590096810483462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20062349339278904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26109726124870203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248900283739198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30134601609065703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248900283739198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248900283739198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30138586299287423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3507096645847026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4202276584391457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4010984020386397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33350692149418837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4202276584391457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4010984020386397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29939596779576405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802895983667615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802895983667615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802895983667615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22108718146175804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802895983667615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3320834475341042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3320834475341042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802895983667615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44218853696604693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5816249841734364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6827749816455467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30075462203050807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34096187407823547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439577553649996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37147423287229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.478643950925716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.478643950925716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49509467271919794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5662281429303259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5093486811180357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41812782285093414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993948620155664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276191353745859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42029197554536124,0.0,0.42029197554536124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42029197554536124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898344096904681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42029197554536124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5829393490289126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8125156708357983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784876106878792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3408505051569662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438127447345947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784876106878792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784876106878792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5995539363747757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48748360220733866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.63473995853142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.3603916663851695,0.0,0.0,0.3603916663851695,0.3603916663851695,0.3603916663851695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3603916663851695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3603916663851695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3603916663851695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3013717432023855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261132415952367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30354163913044446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261132415952367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261132415952367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261132415952367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261132415952367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719535301845691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719535301845691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2649609850421542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34499893718798263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34499893718798263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719535301845691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719535301845691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719535301845691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7331732409915818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6800419095128621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2870318106313998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3282715368418553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36411159603901766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39255945143406634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36411159603901766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2870318106313998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39255945143406634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39255945143406634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27099553801373477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23357162143091623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257748975402576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3606535362260187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3606535362260187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4000290002469322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4000290002469322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34659982481105256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244247134496145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5137121793261153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.394533635876779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4631467067686901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48523518196529464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612270105713117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699610071337269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699610071337269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4923744711565405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5619970495483257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43336252252299595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4672209178844188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43336252252299595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43336252252299595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4672209178844188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508965746787965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508965746787965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508965746787965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47208220236491377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32472601013494895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5561455642284842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5253163248175322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5561455642284842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6480238975738748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4001625374098985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6480238975738748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25885724339806654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22310959989518123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41196525216899915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28644569288972305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41196525216899915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41196525216899915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382111104271972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382111104271972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273866808971017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26643911350362137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4563198711751755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4310243452170567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4310243452170567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4919719126105369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5426906443640945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46532556451146995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6992560214483432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23539342388687887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43464696846770073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43464696846770073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43464696846770073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43464696846770073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43464696846770073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5050434511347328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110226140917481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7589410538184798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3150673097639528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636356740920818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39204634594540033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39204634594540033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39204634594540033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39204634594540033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39204634594540033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43424318793460875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28897063502206743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43424318793460875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40277461069994863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43424318793460875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43424318793460875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49788383263439007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38438651872454843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4596638574907962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42635310443044155,0.4596638574907962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2342736123639577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17992335746679577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2342736123639577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2342736123639577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21121370373485274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1716929198278437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525772915653512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16473418395683465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400644,30대,나는 지금까지 근무했던 회사들이 다 재택근무가 없었던 회사들이었어서 사실 재택근무의 필요성이나 좋았던 경험이 없으니까 그걸 그렇게 크게 필요로 하지는 않거든. 그런데 그냥 재택근무 없이 출퇴근을 해 보면서 출퇴근을 할 때 뭐 날씨라던지 나의 컨디션이라던지 재택근무를 하고 싶었던 때가 있기는 해. 근데 만약에 재택근무가 있는 회사에 근무를 하게 될 기회가 주어진다면 내가 하고 싶을 때 선택해서 할 수 있는 회사였으면 좋겠고. 재택근무를 그렇게 크게 활용하지는 않을 거 같아. 규칙적으로 출퇴근을 하는 것을 더 나는 좋아하는 편인 것 같아. 나는 둘 다 장단점이 있어서 둘 다 좋기도 했고 별로였던 적도 있는데. 사실 그런 회사가 있을까 싶긴 한데 2가지가 적절하게 양립하는 회사였으면 좋겠긴 하거든. 근데 실질적으로 도움이 됐던 건 뭐 내 생활 면에서 도움이 됐던 것들이 그 물질적인 게 많았던 것 같아. 복지 포인트나 건강 검진을 필수로 해 준다거나 이런 부분들이 더 도움이 됐던 것 같고. 가끔 뭐 마음이 그냥 원했던 것들 중에는 뭐 생일 때 일찍 끝내주는 회사들도 있고 그런 복지 제도 같은 경우에는 저런 것들도 많이 도입이 됐으면 좋겠다 요즘에는 스타트업들에는 많이 있는데 그 오래된 기존의 기업들에는 많이 없는 제도인 것 같아서 그리고 내가 겪어본 회사들에서는 없었던 복지 제도였어서 그런 부분도 있는 회사였으면 좋겠다 그런 생각을 가끔씩 하기는 했어. 언니는 그러면 회사 복지 제도 중에서 지금까지 좋은 것들이 많았겠지만 더 추가되었으면 좋겠다 하는 복지 제도나 아니면 이런 거는 굳이 없어도 될 것 같은데 했던 것들이 있는지 궁금해. 나는 둘 다 별로였는데. 사실 둘 다 별로였는데. 둘 중에 골라야 한다면 사실 야자가 더 재미도 있었던 것 같고. 야근은 쪼끔 윗분들이랑 힘들었던 기억이 많은데. 야자라는 거는 친구들이랑 같이 늦게까지 공부한 거였으니까 야자가 더 좋은 기억이었던 것 같아. 사실 나는 그 버스 시간이나 그런 것 때문에 야자를 해 본 기억은 많지는 않은데. 그래서 그런지 야자에 대한 기억이 쪼끔 더 좋은 것 같아. 언니는 학원 학 학교 말고 학원을 다닌 경험이 많지 않잖아. 그랬 그랬는데 그 학원들에서 중에 아 다니 몇 군데 안 다닌 학원들 중에서도 어떤 학원이 좀 도움이 되고 좋았는지를 알고 싶어. 인터넷 강의는 들은 기 들은 적이 많지가 않아 언니가 기억하는 것처럼. 그리고 난 언니보다 학원을 쪼끔 많이 다닌 편이라서 초등학교 때 다녔던 그 영어 학원이나 중학교 때 다녔던 보습 학원 정도가 좀 재미있는 기억이었던 것 같고. 인터넷 강의에 대해서는 그래서 크게 좋았다거나 뭐 도움이 됐다거나 이런 큰 기억이 없는 것 같아. 언니가 학교 다닐 때 좋아했던 과목이나 싫어했던 과목은 어떤 게 있어? 좋아했던 선생님은 보통 국어 과목이나 문학 쪽 내가 잘하고 좋아했던 과목의 선생님들이 내가 잘하니까 또 좋아해 주시고 그런 것 때문에 내가 더 나도 좋아하게 됐던 것 같고. 싫어했던 과목은 못하다 보니까 그 선생님들이랑도 크게 친분을 쌓을 수 없었던 것 같기는 해. 나는 중학교 때랑 고등학교 때 가장 크 컸던 차이는 환경이 변했었잖아 이사랑 전학을 하면서. 그래서 중학교 때 중학교를 다녔던 지역에서 친구들과 어울려서 공부를 했었을 때가 공부도 더 잘 되고 열심히 했었던 것 같고. 고등학교 때가 사실 더 중요하다고는 하는데 그때의 환경에 내가 많이 휘둘린 것도 있고 그래서 고등학교 때 공부를 했던 기억은 많이 없는 것 같아. 그때는 사실 또래 친구들하고 어울려서 노는 게 더 재미있었던 시절이었던 것 같아서 그런 기억이 있어. 그 장소나 어떤 기억이 특별하게 있지는 않은 것 같아. 사실 고등학교 때 기억은 내가 그냥 기억하고 싶지 않은 그런 기억이었기도 했었고 그래서 그런지 자세한 것까지는 기억이 나지는 않는데. 그냥 친구들이랑 가서 1박 2일 2박 3일 이렇게 놀다 오는 거니까 그랬던 기억이 재미있고 뭐 단체 사진 찍고 고기 구워 먹고 이랬던 기억이 재미있게 남아 있지 어디로 갔었고 뭐 고등학교 몇 학년 때였고 이런 기억은 자세하게 나지는 않아. 그런 면에서 나는 중학교 때가 더 재미있었던 것 같아 학교 다닌 거. 모르겠어. 그냥 다 그 일을 할 때 언니가 하는 것처럼 내 일을 열심히 해야겠다는 거는 기본적으로 다들 가지고 있을 테니까 그렇게 하고. 사적인 대화나 회식 자리나 그런 기회가 있을 때는 업무에서 사실 벗어나서 그런 사적으로 친분을 쌓으려는 대화를 많이 했었던 것 같아. 그래서 그런 부분을 다들 친근하게 봐 주고 그래서 친해진 것 같고. 나랑 그런 성격이 안 맞았던 사람들도 많았어. 그래서 그런 사람들하고는 아무리 그렇게 노력을 해도 친해지기는 쉽지가 않더라고. 그래서 특별히 뭔가 친해져야 한다는 강박이나 친해지 친해져야 좋다는 그런 언니가 그런 고정관념은 버리고 그냥 열심히 일 하는 것도 언니도 일 그만두고 퇴사하고 나서도 사람들이 언니를 좋게 평가해 주는 부분이 많다 보니까 꼭 그 부분을 나를 부러워한다는 건 좀 놀라웠고 그러지는 않아도 될 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25311904558759435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028330444820327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028330444820327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028330444820327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028330444820327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3529283781838866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028330444820327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
