SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49903780019132626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33954940371492764,0.0,0.0,0.6094284824853923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140665337800069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4241337331675045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4241337331675045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21984813454729998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3231121251880084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4241337331675045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3573620822781079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4241337331675045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22760413483772127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818840961566979,0.290925649707662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818840961566979,0.0,0.0,0.20205031948304797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818840961566979,0.3364048729321799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818840961566979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35528045600842817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25401982898474684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25401982898474684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2883612593128985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21384293105855295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2883612593128985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2883612593128985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26827281034980155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42539899362349504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718096420011691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5243785143333826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5243785143333826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.441825262010156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3777834972074484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3032455386731749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33654923385843216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3613415737344341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32671021800587047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4288567764090264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29683426488408554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3777834972074484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24338332572483448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4083591074929619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799111075465237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4083591074929619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35972693036816017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4083591074929619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4083591074929619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30403430600781695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23161838604676577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15759504558861304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30403430600781695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26782634602729133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5657080143831943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28285400719159715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30403430600781695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30403430600781695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28285400719159715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31426549690345607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19530719740367478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841459617943404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29270313713951335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2438624418186526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372984726185006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372984726185006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372984726185006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841459617943404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372984726185006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47452702711983386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44146949370282496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47452702711983386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44146949370282496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998219270189764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37590051371865163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040481976945005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040481976945005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040481976945005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29963404616069667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3404386257855097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040481976945005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34540313096746555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533874322874831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533874322874831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46704138581503596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5014466008872414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6894446047632026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5252303554842841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4987977652724238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40314598985668204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3881577472236935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.478472177572428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.478472177572428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.478472177572428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21536998395234497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37108888173003496,0.0,0.7421777634600699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3452372812786803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28270167598784063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2568500755364859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45079682892826245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42333065999639174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5556857796161614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5556857796161614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4021365354491879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2909367972867709,0.0,0.0,0.30635429446828333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37412202584475474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2127656435055482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629222876823378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3542454149587356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37412202584475474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37412202584475474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4614254831926789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32046389306128326,0.0,0.6056910202650412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5634960555981763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3995412984612592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48648254324134793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3610691847668269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48648254324134793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48648254324134793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19596204943316728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16094088630188397,0.0,0.0,0.16946956223455956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.222454536631775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.222454536631775,0.222454536631775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23539608299613768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18743337350049166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.222454536631775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19596204943316728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19596204943316728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19596204943316728,0.0,0.16946956223455956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39192409886633456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44490907326355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.222454536631775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18743337350049166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19596204943316728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36500724021585684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36500724021585684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20544185800466017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20758200529186996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923392285253554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923392285253554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36500724021585684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923392285253554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23069956027048957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22054644793646405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1698459682408397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503625473575301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.181131708431802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42189561570573614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14921687381214402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12977449019676354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503625473575301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13246383703662246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1964742733123075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329212472784327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658424945568654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22054644793646405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329212472784327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503625473575301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329212472784327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906857361719871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15043633157295877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18684114021325543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2346523019211256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449842160005973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20630350163083855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20630350163083855,0.0,0.0,0.2217516469647451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2217516469647451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2217516469647451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906857361719871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17989472275208696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20630350163083855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19534286808599355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906857361719871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15680106118074266,0.19534286808599355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2348694524633992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20311699845136505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17432099652035932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2348694524633992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666219064754333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666219064754333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17748149841734157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666219064754333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666219064754333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22464744543530646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666219064754333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24804791157252035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20311699845136505,0.43259091512097236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2348694524633992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18852891710890987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3865006913515838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5911482451294784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4795655460446581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5207474002930547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30388790691586326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30388790691586326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23150685678599825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560466350638037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21033675674160363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676973818509308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560466350638037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560466350638037,0.0,0.0,0.28271780687146864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676973818509308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676973818509308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23150685678599825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28271780687146864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30388790691586326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38754691782190676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38754691782190676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38754691782190676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38754691782190676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31439516364034814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38754691782190676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38754691782190676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812577261763238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3023184943935825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39531981378341696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3023184943935825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25472429618090686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663148733216429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663148733216429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23031125224970322,0.2452541051043841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3023184943935825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3023184943935825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812577261763238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18097629107166371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3456165121852922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3044564569068851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3456165121852922,0.0,0.0,0.3456165121852922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5265928032569559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3456165121852922,0.0,0.3456165121852922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3863896518999706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41532276961674747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34993823447930167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3863896518999706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3658612781859166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41532276961674747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3163997867550858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5413072036175152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5811833073767018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6076285662626999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720058309174855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29193494022521893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32770302701601994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22171665736459312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720058309174855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2476321363237534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720058309174855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31344070975785276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2758720690976994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32770302701601994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38903086324971803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667521485392008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667521485392008,0.0,0.28672672932038046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667521485392008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19086462259909437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525799579349421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667521485392008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28672672932038046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525799579349421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28672672932038046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667521485392008,0.28672672932038046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799813487414878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30094654095563267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575856096938955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19676290524002693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799813487414878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5599626974829756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30094654095563267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799813487414878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799813487414878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2231759237119086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799813487414878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45536019898232954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45536019898232954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3258161293221546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48945787777860705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48945787777860705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38327050468514295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3569735787089905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40071024803481936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42319398767378147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42319398767378147,0.0,0.4548830388742716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3540047638190006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31536589852705427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21042900462202083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32600928543806595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3738678718370592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4018633502179938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2907391538765772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781506990390727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4018633502179938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35806942101782663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700136183514497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6169642518830657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5198351663695957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320316833062873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23988217424747713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4627836496926501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24485330814500042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4627836496926501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4305442089648689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4076699617416522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45350337233781235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270289451029097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4219104344670732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4219104344670732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3994948883208188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45350337233781235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4731990268219946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4325638862999277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.542665258370121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.542665258370121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4594043093324268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2935374148157002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.419953766097923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52684545844176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49885485256693074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6133564686873022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49758183712720533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6133564686873022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41619436537071247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44735928013257953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666275525504513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44735928013257953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44735928013257953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39408250645316223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27294013739092243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4100248219322222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33263023148909365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28992942361162677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4100248219322222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217706872669694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3814607813651406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3814607813651406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3566243774098802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23555626897033696,0.0,0.3686602102263012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4544380598685631,0.0,0.422780007762983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3686602102263012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4003182623318813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920305751382048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15450989344495025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920305751382048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920305751382048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920305751382048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2224737444204099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5840611502764096,0.0,0.0,0.2920305751382048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2716865063187451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920305751382048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967926789283447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967926789283447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967926789283447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967926789283447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.349537967353679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36915044467477126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33432534808199504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4866834828681224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37076356381518033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4866834828681224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4527790800018209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42872352334165137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.3801501489402023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26312185375990604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20113290869640993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3801501489402023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3801501489402023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28960469990746196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28960469990746196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3801501489402023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3801501489402023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086227373928051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086227373928051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4731899544803849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086227373928051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955166684343763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643581246587852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643581246587852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5250425820261483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28087871872581543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.368695973483408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.368695973483408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.737391946966816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32478734610461174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3662212357613948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110909349321843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24690800111084607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4341571320017176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39319940250006924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4341571320017176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32300478017995454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23361379846301922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3744820479180806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40252351621816457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3744820479180806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35458630953309717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35458630953309717,0.35458630953309717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35458630953309717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7647363077567054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6443433708812729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3738574336070382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3738574336070382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243999407026107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243999407026107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243999407026107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243999407026107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2477872092516091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835776948393708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34630708168079805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37223878950774036,0.3279082421735556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279082421735556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279082421735556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37223878950774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37223878950774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173280273374787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2348902593902756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173280273374787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173280273374787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779579302062001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245360371857783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173280273374787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47578479486291225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47578479486291225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4426396400949131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41912277853342617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41912277853342617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4042801892864973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4042801892864973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4589356073651697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38668507466915797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38668507466915797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4042801892864973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41613355571569166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4394826928231962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7960451158799278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19340917914579417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2402131930595789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2652350698007566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2652350698007566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23128249869126377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28509605070287847,0.2652350698007566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22373170419162575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2402131930595789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28509605070287847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511434795933856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22373170419162575,0.0,0.28509605070287847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21719090848389275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21719090848389275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28509605070287847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28676499269009026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20284721687092813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2761035861593835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5047873452004259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403458646649234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403458646649234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28676499269009026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403458646649234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403458646649234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41696223702515717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26011428998698793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44818465053436435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948095820971306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44818465053436435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44818465053436435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18724061133299136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2930432012642138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678786278237721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36122689714313383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336062323702692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5503773045323549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36122689714313383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36122689714313383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40824829046386296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40824829046386296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8164965809277259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310353051192825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24548914822762852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310353051192825,0.0,0.0,0.3079740040009652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310353051192825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310353051192825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310353051192825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27892020062048495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310353051192825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310353051192825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19304042596187865,0.3326143898247859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1982392332975901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326143898247859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326143898247859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326143898247859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094430830746771,0.0,0.3326143898247859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094430830746771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326143898247859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26102215057237815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358105312627705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3575214609005941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6014584375080689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4725814506873551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.406840263869296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680405217430762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4618417833656075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296679569775817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891337294819383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4618417833656075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.211050004260583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3671020040725835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6238748686726475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541088573737218,0.0,0.0,0.3294401562947956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2983612684592052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3294401562947956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30784353945538456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43535937427744836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43535937427744836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43535937427744836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38351168969221205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43535937427744836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3398007415253365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44603355290391533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5854867742924436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5854867742924436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3595922454531435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2542684415254115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3029814031685263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.719184490906287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29171709966996595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3345415486725729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4644007719303041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6262315558284082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6262315558284082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25766207136618535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13355817117021798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13632592810788244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16846293554724073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25766207136618535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20902684388863899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25766207136618535,0.2397122559759391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170981630247871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22697665927888527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22697665927888527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2397122559759391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170981630247871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5732310854951782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22697665927888527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33297562662934094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31528506978469756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33297562662934094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2589392115242506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3579090661112512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3579090661112512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3579090661112512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3579090661112512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31528506978469756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5287142530010723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6001921520119695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6001921520119695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4032608123127364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21336048498167542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32714296836457984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4032608123127364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3751679808891809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4032608123127364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4032608123127364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371215654996793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21282111472038964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18404941798812907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21282111472038964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12522873038473067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21282111472038964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17083079078748514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22476244778215637,0.20355869720469605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20355869720469605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21282111472038964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17916038737940193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24159281145265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16721905431763517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22476244778215637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17083079078748514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5489185497958685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3653971574005733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.430768796359849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4625019436467688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.407066996032876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3435418395117179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3931631629568361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4801336285108652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4801336285108652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5160863584175254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30981360472465086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28823069583663347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16222869894754932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22975156050434073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30981360472465086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20623280181096243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28823069583663347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2360211518361001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30981360472465086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30981360472465086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5220788927852743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31397289844861226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19512535566557984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3022999509295177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726374568995216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726374568995216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3022999509295177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31397289844861226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31397289844861226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34667797623800317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2924306144270335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411568728213303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22476601828339063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3872785280708002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3872785280708002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3872785280708002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2738454708463649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3602990892786712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3263090162138167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680557787797313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36491713320121416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24689490275745282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21472544839577198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270842877350776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4142509838516326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4142509838516326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4142509838516326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4142509838516326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19926160890925282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993411174037966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993411174037966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993411174037966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993411174037966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993411174037966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993411174037966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26369207719580173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993411174037966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784877656954189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.252215649597079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21166474074218172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784877656954189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915626677982812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29075979186931344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2197156037076464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070742422481827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2197156037076464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070742422481827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25902398043798225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33006816859964927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29075979186931344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29075979186931344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070742422481827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24477193916638038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070742422481827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29224545346961495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718864153286725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24623706067483597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153029431137631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29224545346961495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29224545346961495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24623706067483597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21672337160473418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23708240974567657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24623706067483597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718864153286725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20664738168356564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718864153286725,0.0,0.0,0.29224545346961495,0.29224545346961495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.29036134916543416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29036134916543416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2701335655946995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29036134916543416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22120210033906554,0.4892991442859858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2701335655946995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29036134916543416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29036134916543416,0.2446495721429929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29036134916543416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4804541355000478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5305007795046908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5702250356455479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4032073354353204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37363080656392805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5221859297660919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5221859297660919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5612875643509597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2599026946113846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.384142990274813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3674242884376994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4360760216027039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.384142990274813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.384142990274813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4056971457271107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21725836340960003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29794106690409633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29794106690409633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28211185011193796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29794106690409633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28211185011193796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3202510949263529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3202510949263529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3202510949263529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28211185011193796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29794106690409633,0.22645023031883216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255439329269195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19402521851838875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26409560586859065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2414168566585516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3028651837168804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255439329269195,0.0,0.3255439329269195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255439329269195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28677435507862975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3028651837168804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23019280732561556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3028651837168804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816808866480514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5379354666629218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4363969916725171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5379354666629218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891842894678995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095543957011469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2930414828797981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3709176512625636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44022210505613857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3877953096338957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112819867308454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095543957011469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5390876624867108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015325657295954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45421873935362056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015325657295954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648672027921106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44976251612490137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37895610917974065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44976251612490137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41843018191253994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37895610917974065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4653058212237302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3329323510508772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34617882195755245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3536558806064957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42140957132601226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5001482349208055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24605876741191895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40967699826874204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40967699826874204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35429197518089045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46506202135659364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27346132128752315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.432663859748625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45831023761063433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339608178257493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49262881728891544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.340974238684302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49262881728891544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19353841998139043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403133352229521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36579622727292777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36579622727292777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36579622727292777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32223293557720417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32223293557720417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36579622727292777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32223293557720417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24931650853326348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14974361031833078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633055879068209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633055879068209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830220879034756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40025104055177374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830220879034756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24931650853326348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830220879034756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830220879034756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633055879068209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2384657355795363,0.0,0.2830220879034756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16641994090567475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36043695099535195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2217397850188737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42778312859225404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36043695099535195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3768377119259712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42778312859225404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42778312859225404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383945285110864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107608561428542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21508803440010651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21732866869831377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107608561428542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107608561428542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36184265070716726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30461201914226593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.346094506025948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4486931568289204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5717591409385981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3806013932202697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5717591409385981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3380496205701475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38375120039825183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3380496205701475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38375120039825183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38375120039825183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2923480407420431,0.311315910146992,0.0,0.38375120039825183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4780947528287137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297122487795929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4998492308911707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3336517102539048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5674248119229179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065615349397258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591166235209165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29988025667124907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591166235209165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1883086146024663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591166235209165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3135255402191652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591166235209165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2711394180862387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3311173703533426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20927977125402367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18295917050909677,0.0,0.2473906484367877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3152440871310019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18788647769379088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634055937150514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3152440871310019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3152440871310019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2656150044035861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3152440871310019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3152440871310019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3152440871310019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27770113534764895,0.3152440871310019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4548485567063262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3027778342161174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2357690484711463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4548485567063262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4006798724066043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4548485567063262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26745569749988646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3764714543991237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3353803977255805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2237837495834289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22152427085271015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39759516212490115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3600866337577769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3600866337577769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3764714543991237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29580335891443793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5831271528546286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22739209222156828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28099672532989955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4297811744786662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4297811744786662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998408239288503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34519640657103473,0.0,0.34519640657103473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.321148584016195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23418126443484813,0.34519640657103473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34519640657103473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34519640657103473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29085191061288745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629763581912054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30408638238112007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610267005178761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583911906604011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3911956913745618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49849147247967085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46376447576968316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49849147247967085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33818426998919116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2777460038964257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19899523044259265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35715969453528046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3234657872390403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35715969453528046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3839040533318058,0.0,0.33818426998919116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3839040533318058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3161340816522216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732881933442772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21313901697011123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3268033942269079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3161340816522216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028422279143538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3161340816522216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5576564632532534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30980089755256174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2367100847832566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3478942348328014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.456664015568069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847711010537248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40227912520043524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.456664015568069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5146168936920263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5146168936920263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5146168936920263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533302970024271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46766422600663093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8839062007439584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27901500694654097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27377824759446684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2176053914834803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27377824759446684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465351852801483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112838745224819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112838745224819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826321230965923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465351852801483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47441271420078746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3158010551257983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47441271420078746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47441271420078746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47441271420078746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970190934052225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15552906764225108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539587363693131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1571492589481011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970190934052225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23308841978403158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970190934052225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763275035808703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616465869644796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616465869644796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970190934052225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970190934052225,0.0,0.2970190934052225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2055824906993846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970190934052225,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.645567717214253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.645567717214253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4080252994381067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5175691500519628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5175691500519628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5563250770582645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3933786451564115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5046824114519457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5046824114519457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38447544667437633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5046824114519457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29675852408597403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5156854100863877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44967285160670156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5156854100863877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5156854100863877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401597,30대,나는 기억에 남는 나라 사실 나는 지금까지 되게 많은 곳을 갔었거든. 근데 기억에 남아 있지 않아 내가 기억력이 좋지 않아서. 우리 엄마랑 아빠가 어릴 때부터 거의 뭐 전국에 안 가 본 데가 없을 정도 우리를 다 데리고 다녔다고 하는데 나는 하나도 기억이 나질 않더라고. 지금 뭔가 항상 어떤 사람들이 나한테 질문을 하면은 질문에 대한 답을 바로 떠올리긴 어려워. 근데 뭐 얘기를 하다 보면은 엄마랑 아빠가 얘기를 해 주면은 그때서야 기억에 나는 게 있더라고. 그래서 지금 네가 물어봤을 때 특별히 뭐 기억에 남는 여행지는 없는 거 같고 그나마 가장 최근에 놀러 갔었던 우리 신혼여행으로 갔었던 뉴질랜드가 제일 기간이 짧아서 그게 쪼끔 기억에 남는 거 같아. 그때 우리가 겨울이었는데 그 나라는 여름이었으니까. 어 우리나라는 춥지만 거기는 날씨가 따뜻하고 더울 때 오히려 더웠다고 하면은 더 더웠다고 할 수 있을 거 같아. 햇빛이 되게 뜨거웠던 기억이 나. 그때 내가 차에서 타서 그냥 구경을 한 게 아니라 네가 잘 기억을 해 봐. 그때 내가 내리려고 했는데 네가 나한테 그냥 차에 있으라고. 그냥 차에 있고 내가 나가 있을 테니까 만약에 내가 필요하면 손짓을 할 테니까 그때 나오라고 하면서 나보고 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 했어. 그래서 내가 차 안에서 동영상으로 그걸 촬영을 하고 있었던 거야. 근데 왜 말을 그렇게 하니? 내가 마치 나는 나몰라라 하 해 가지고 그냥 가만히 앉아 있었던 거처럼 그렇게 말을 하면 안 되지. 네가 차에 가만히 앉아 있으라고 해서 내가 차에 가만히 앉아 있었는데 이제 와 가지고 그렇게 말하면은 내가 무슨 말을 해야 될지 모르겠다. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하니까 뉴질랜드 가서 운전을 많이 해서 운전 실력이 좀 늘었으면 그게 오히려 더 도움이 된 게 아닐까 싶어. 네가 평소에 운전을 잘 못하잖아. 그리고 너 내 만약에 신혼여행 가기 전에 나한테 운전 연습을 시켜 줬으면은 그때 그렇게 고생하지 않고 둘이서 반반 나눠서 운전을 했으면 됐었을 텐데. 네가 그전에 운전 연습을 시켜 주지 않아서 네가 혼자 독박 운전을 하게 된 거잖아. 그래서 운전 연습해 준다고 해 놓고서는 운전 연습시켜 주지도 않고. 언제 운전 연습을 시켜 줄 예정인 거야 대체? 해외여행 가는 거 좋아. 해외여행 근데 우리 둘 다 사실 각자 많이 다녀 봤잖아. 너 같은 경우에도 뭐 아빠가 항공사 다니셔 가지고 어릴 때부터 뭐 그거 혜택이 있어 가지고 여기저기 많이 다녔다고 했잖아. 그래서 우리 신혼여행 갈 때도 어디 갈까 저 결정할 때도 웬만한 데는 다 네가 가 봐서 선택지가 많이 없었던 걸로 기억을 해. 나 같은 경우에도 유럽은 웬만한 데는 다 또 다 다 가 본 거 같고. 그래서 우리가 다음에 해외여행을 간다고 하면은 어디로 가야 될지 그게 쪼끔 애매한 거 같아. 그리고 나는 내가 추운 나라를 워낙 싫어하니까 근데 그렇다고 더운 나라가 좋지도 않거든. 너무 더운 것도 싫고 너무 추운 것도 싫어 나는. 그건 나도 모르지. 근데 우리나라에 봄이랑 가을이 있는 것처럼 뭔가 그런 나라들도 딱 성수기가 있으면은 날씨가 좋지 않을까? 어 나는 나도 캐나다에 가는 게 좋은 생각이라고 생각해. 내가 그 대학교 때 친했던 친구가 있는데 그 친구가 캐나다로 워킹 홀리데이를 갔다 왔었거든. 캐나다 그 서브웨이에서 아르바이트를 하면서 돈을 벌었다고 하는데 걔는 되게 캐나다가 좋았다고 했어. 그리고 내가 지금 다니는 회사에도 친한 동료가 1명 있는데 그분이 캐나다에서 학교를 나왔어. 그래서 그 중고등학교를 캐나다에서 나왔는데 캐나다 되게 살기도 좋고 사람들도 좋고. 그다음에 내가 만약에 캐나다로 놀러 간다고 하면은 그 사람한테 캐나다에 대한 정보를 물어보면은 정말 잘 알려 줄 거 같아. 어떤 게 맛있고 어디를 가야 되고 뭐를 꼭 봐야 되는지. 그 사람이 그런 정보를 사람들한테 알려 주는 걸 되게 좋아한단 말이야. 그래서 우리가 캐나다를 만약에 나중에 가게 된다면 그 사람한테 정보를 구하면은 좀 좋을 거 같네. 너는 산이랑 바다 중에 어떤 게 더 좋아? 산이 좋아? 바다가 좋아? 언제 갈까? 지금 단풍철 아직 아닌 걸로 알고 있는데 날씨가 또 갑자기 추워져 가지고 곧 단풍이 그거 되지 않을까 싶어. 근데 날씨가 진짜 한창 너무 더웠는데 갑자기 너무 추워지는 바람에 뭐 가을이 없고 바로 겨울이 오는 거 같아. 지금 요 며칠째 날씨가 너무 추워져서 나는 지금 벌써 춥거든. 아침도 춥고 오후에도 춥고 밤에는 진짜 너무 추워서 벌써 롱 패딩을 꺼내서 입 입고 싶을 지경이야. 근데 사람들은 아직도 뭐 반팔을 입은 사람도 많긴 하는 거 같아서 참 대단한 거 같아. 그래서 등산을 간다고 하면은 더 추워지기 전에 진짜 빨리 가야 될 거 같아. 근데 나는 산과 바다 바다 중에서 나는 산이 좀 더 좋아. 뭔가 바다는 옛날에 그 세월호 사건 있었었잖아. 그때 이후로 좀 더 무서워진 거 같아. 뭔가 그 밤에 깜깜한 밤에 바다를 보고 있으면은 너무 그 무서움이 느껴져 난. 네가 캠핑을 말해서 생각난 건데 내가 최근에 캠핑을 가 보고 싶다는 생각을 했어. 나는 원래 캠핑을 좋아하지 않거든. 그거는 가면은 그냥 거의 하루 종일 노동을 해야 되잖아. 짐을 싣고 가서 음식도 내가 다 요리해서 만든 다음에 그것도 뒷정리도 하고 그다음에 뭐 텐트를 친다고 하면은 막 추운 데서 자야 되고 이러니까 그게 뭔가 나는 노동이라고 생각을 해서 캠핑을 가고 싶다는 생각이 단 한번도 한 적이 없는데 최근에 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 다니잖아. 그런 걸 좋아하는 사람도 되게 많고. 그래서 주변에서 캠핑 간다 캠핑 갔는데 너무 좋았다 이런 얘기를 많이 들었어. 그래서 요새 문득 갑자기 나도 한번 가 보고 싶다는 생각이 들더라고. 캠핑 가서 뭔가 고기도 구워 먹고 하면은 재밌을 거 같아. 근데 대신에 나는 아무것도 안 할 거고 네가 다 해 줬으면 좋겠어. 맞아. 요새는 그 휴양림에도 카라반이라고 해서 캠핑 존을 따로 만들어 놨어. 옛날에는 그런 게 또 없었는데 요새는 워낙 사람들이 캠핑을 많이 하다 보니까 그런 거를 또 추 시설을 새로 만든 거 같아. 그래서 어떤 휴양림이었는지 기억은 안 나는데 최근에 우리 가족끼리 갔던 휴양림에 휴양림인데 거기는 이제 카라반이라고 해서 동물 캐릭터 모양을 한 이런 캠핑카들을 그 캠핑 존에다가 이렇게 한 10대 정도 이렇게 놓아두고 그 캠핑카 하나하나를 예약을 해서 받아서 쓰는 그런 시스템이었어. 근데 그 이미 있는 캠핑카를 예약을 해도 되고 아니면 자기의 캠핑카를 가지고 와서 거기에 주차를 해서 사용을 해도 되는 시스템이었어. 근데 그 캠핑카 모양이 그 동물 모양으로 해서 정말 너무 귀엽고 아담하고 했던 기억이 나. 그래서 우리가 다음에 기회가 되면은 우리도 그런 휴양림에 캠핑카를 예약을 해서 가면은 재밌을 거 같다는 생각이 들어. 나도 그 더러운 사 샤워 시설은 진짜 싫어. 그리고 뭔가 샤워 시설 그런 거는 좀 내가 혼자 사용을 하고 이런 게 마음이 편한데 여럿이서 같이 사용을 한다고 하면은 뭐가 내가 씻는 동안 다른 사람이 들어올 수도 있고 그다음에 뭔가 다른 사람이 사용하고 난 뒤에를 내가 쓴다는 게 쪼끔 비위생적이기도 하고 뭔가 찝찝한 느낌이 있어서 공용 샤워 시설을 나는 별로 좋아하지는 않지. 그래서 내가 캠핑을 안 좋아했던 이유 중에 하나도 그거였던 거 같아. 아무래도 화장실 같은 거도 그 차 안에 있을 수도 있지만 그렇지 않은 경우에도 있잖아. 그래서 뭐 공용 화장실을 써야 하고 공용 그 개수대 이런 걸 써야 하고 그렇기 때문에 내가 좋아하지 않았던 거 같아. 어 나는 근데 패키지는 별로인 거 같아. 패키지 여행 같은 경우에는 다 상품 코스가 또 짜여져 있으니까 나는 그런 거에 또 얽매여서 하고 싶진 않거든. 그래서 나는 간다고 하면은 자유여행을 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어. 내가 계획을 안 세우면은 네가 계획을 세웠으면 된 거 아니야? 2명이 있는데 둘 중에 1사람만 계획을 세워도 어쨌든 계획이 만들어지는 거잖아. 그래서 나는 문제가 되지 않는다고 생각해. 아니야. 나는 그래도 자유 여 패키지여행은 싫고 자유여행을 가고 싶어. 다음에 뭐 간다고 하면은 내가 계획을 세우거나 하면은 되지 않을까? 나는 원래 여행 계획을 세우는 걸 되게 좋아했어. 그 엠비티아이로 따지면은 그 계획형이라고 하지. 내가 제이거든. 내가 옛날 지금은 사실 그런 게 쪼끔 많이 없어져 가지고 제이 성향을 많이 내려 둔 케이스. 그래서 옛날에 나는 언니랑 여행을 가거나 하면은 정말 그 사람들이 흔히 말하는 타임 테이블을 내가 다 짰었어. 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 뭘 하고 이동을 몇 시부터 몇 시까지 해서 그다음 코스에는 뭘 하고 이런 식으로. 다음에 여행을 가게 된다면 내가 한번 계획을 짜는 데 도움을 주도록 해 볼게.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968840694733055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315415750211794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4376238816443938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4376238816443938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4376238816443938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4071371753774242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434292989813976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3087741339663146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2528433917990123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3087741339663146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2604578770615493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3087741339663146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318953493560477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2796448475308035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318953493560477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318953493560477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2796448475308035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3087741339663146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3935998106725614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3935998106725614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34321535144331305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21929821932695784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42307282994078566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726883707115373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816257703283446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35646819773993543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3351778325707326,0.31182794569895805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3351778325707326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3351778325707326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3351778325707326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3351778325707326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824105672670817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26303383545098075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3351778325707326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824105672670817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.378543385427765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31894905278766184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378543385427765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19621654828064938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378543385427765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378543385427765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378543385427765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.378543385427765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25701976235963636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2596972116025302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4566453742727452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49083928786149567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4566453742727452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4566453742727452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43792300722654065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5748404513970433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53479466612988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43792300722654065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5151206300980002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39760355905897005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7593168944986535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3872276508645382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31413616019407903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048775305315313,0.0,0.0,0.3872276508645382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3602517563909623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3602517563909623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3872276508645382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3872276508645382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40077634102284215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47565976949660316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47565976949660316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47565976949660316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40077634102284215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20666717421807296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20882008597886947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39467925612508187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39467925612508187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39467925612508187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39467925612508187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39467925612508187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36718425172555313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44585718273605474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32256770862074696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3927592963773953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44585718273605474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41479691034868554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41479691034868554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21972663208012952,0.0,0.0,0.2383383381025106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.2675397291941325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23137051749576323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037089408925018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17858402632197712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29736067557289986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3903253360316742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2682893924467249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3903253360316742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.265580553323959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4020801479635224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3410621761710477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4316999084111067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48306524119809024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40701596447304733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48306524119809024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494129001493081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40701596447304733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41097387474005476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2554087434748433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4877626708928877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32468768544377213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4877626708928877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296741890383766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.569123680778611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8222519297496391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4455951249343903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5288527608046155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5288527608046155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49201067001984544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779644730092272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779644730092272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7559289460184544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779644730092272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36978039703998905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6569864754943392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6569864754943392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.562956657740786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.562956657740786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6051112319323176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780214991937828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33300227917775327,0.0,0.3780214991937828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780214991937828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879830591617237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780214991937828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3516869436726902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33300227917775327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27431313368552146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3834342803241934,0.0,0.4726496801232334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37091611111023404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4726496801232334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43972293053418077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37285603401747464,0.0,0.37285603401747464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3284519779901423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2580732143068993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19727367950798502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37285603401747464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30247727033423166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37285603401747464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37285603401747464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33741388407533485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33400711528208427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5994810981219675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.64437064704145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46725071792506345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46725071792506345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46725071792506345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3559593605933841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46725071792506345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41372195932685696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34858944079987614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41372195932685696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151802628777311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41372195932685696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36445111110229406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36445111110229406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648219564226017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4002084583143715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074643805322277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6121141128912116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074643805322277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6196087918820427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48184010838135005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6196087918820427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32832333160374927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32832333160374927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4183747025574396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32832333160374927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4183747025574396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4183747025574396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38922897445304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3674445287445892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632610645936295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44740143142203614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3380834570439533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4725050002664195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5078864933453625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.440914440705475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49493560710064627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.561846905860669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49493560710064627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4155708998699744,0.35250562899184124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4926614090409346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4926614090409346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4664869567243313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159872657279411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40265514383369616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547022613931587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40265514383369616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547022613931587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40265514383369616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40265514383369616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5907420940356287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5907420940356287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5495885339677318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3283709488587125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3250554839238666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6271010493997956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6271010493997956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17152346310066965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309051808900108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2684448868282889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309051808900108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.278810561933696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29149712294964786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309051808900108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5829942458992957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25968083340276454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4289785015974735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37789072593722356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4289785015974735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4289785015974735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34800629293072227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4289785015974735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4141391326270715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3489409382347114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28664741180594805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36481860252825743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852884720035762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4141391326270715,0.4141391326270715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5305955326088816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5305955326088816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46740601277208366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46740601277208366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49561434621680583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5327262827055359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5327262827055359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43217107174540365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2123564280661263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30680586429513945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20059380982315028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30680586429513945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20423064720432554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30680586429513945,0.30680586429513945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30680586429513945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24889445761303985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30680586429513945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30680586429513945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30680586429513945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24076867675123909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2744023485257935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294567405754282,0.46633558861244245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5293803957437527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4925015477067385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5329937920738803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5982965893312051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5982965893312051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45145968011488824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32345496179848904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5496985022551104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6240133023718238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43611815036964846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6619537308043624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6096049681493275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3137269028529518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38199470785855205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3653695037399669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4034283237869542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886581989575489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4336373087455672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4336373087455672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955079765153171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3971981327831847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42694059683777325,0.0,0.0,0.37609551870383945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30189060402309253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42694059683777325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3971981327831847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.292415937803542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3139571406524387,0.0,0.0,0.21625788105667157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2220819619601444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32824295677667914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37261875482325485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32824295677667914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6045695579597145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4444892012435881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.645296985207921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.621306004203569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541355053625783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2556070996082129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541355053625783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36199593778387085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43000788360805664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541355053625783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4816418767972693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5177075453527832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5177075453527832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4816418767972693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786592056183683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16608177205502356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786592056183683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2592466422126593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786592056183683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24547320928223273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786592056183683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22606064587652375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6368616388382916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786592056183683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30541615666621985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27555733439711594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5262411128963577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5262411128963577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5262411128963577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4300705247884677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2251992185886455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4300705247884677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37885269823851214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37885269823851214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4300705247884677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3276348716885566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39927738965699244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6060356751610845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6879668062782873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.562956657740786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6051112319323176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.562956657740786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3982963828117311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4849667306491683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5505303177857456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5505303177857456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4745048686497035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643753120181724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4297407944819829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5100361132219049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5100361132219049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6811444743735295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7321490319807902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36576779349490646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47034884953448475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.505568888592505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.505568888592505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36576779349490646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4575549881920856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49126137536511355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4575549881920856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5830515643023848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35653176546877147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.300742505682594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35653176546877147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7130635309375429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832291045133191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3863896518999706,0.0,0.3163997867550858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41532276961674747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34993823447930167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3863896518999706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41532276961674747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3658612781859166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35486067815736627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35486067815736627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125997195106347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3301396021045008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3301396021045008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878786434577692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125997195106347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35486067815736627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35486067815736627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28802603056451515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3949895483689886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3740042734730575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4245666321331652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3234419148129498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3949895483689886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4245666321331652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40838248541153005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4841395072499875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5203922000582115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4841395072499875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30599604371160494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3489544132384225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5242174072244234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4416895180986838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4617874691325398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4416895180986838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30963074900308585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2880605786078848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30963074900308585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18454091033182438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21894056112959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6192614980061717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2608853777668598,0.30963074900308585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30963074900308585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5744643479749918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5494624648403421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6066973814326575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31521390034075786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38855615371815116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20346091431905458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342282343868377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342282343868377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.281111694570485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38855615371815116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30492295572380423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38855615371815116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19011047792841088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19523037829293358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16979261236757515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32756600230432603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32756600230432603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5771112255843873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28855561279219366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21804999329605687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27599707241573895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24291638278594704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28855561279219366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3542011550708981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298776583768442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3807239764370813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3542011550708981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3807239764370813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3807239764370813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33538291383309354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33538291383309354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886177792309564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886177792309564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177177406249342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177177406249342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177177406249342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4177177406249342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6173568111146811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7866832703002599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39372575677765903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33211646790967425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42320820697517153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42320820697517153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372807625465817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31384272507079214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372807625465817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582493452730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582493452730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582493452730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582493452730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582493452730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33329220052442093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27292030377759735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21065435320432702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582493452730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.645567717214253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.645567717214253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4080252994381067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5707291418665839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4673483823739897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5707291418665839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36072424750892607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6047599399035486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4036801014620344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6865186019121825,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30525673956197746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44102530197044665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29357614484272543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44102530197044665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29357614484272543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38850285246853233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44102530197044665,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2506454309342396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694655176226505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694655176226505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694655176226505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694655176226505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34372700749104756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694655176226505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694655176226505
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43915622156728196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6473410670754762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4931551808957966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3806433021766787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160891857371563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160891857371563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160891857371563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160891857371563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3665364205136388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160891857371563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4462211053959563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4796344427010501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4462211053959563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4796344427010501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.376397466713218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28484533810686735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14915448481812618,0.265001822890675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16976872667608903,0.28484533810686735,0.265001822890675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28484533810686735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28484533810686735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28484533810686735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.265001822890675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24000195031146082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.265001822890675,0.0,0.0,0.20607923698927552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28484533810686735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28484533810686735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3685809654807321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3685809654807321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3429040769435156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31055502312580846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29900914606237117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3685809654807321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27333225752515466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21672945369260246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28924724609931746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28924724609931746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36514586909765023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24306568370564377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32166002965753776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36514586909765023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27078485888784404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3397082837128033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36514586909765023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36514586909765023,0.0,0.3397082837128033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3795953726529046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48370945905699336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39240646110490457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48370945905699336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48370945905699336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30803094109093704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4257642780722766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4257642780722766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28341737947856116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4257642780722766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4257642780722766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157382561719582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2698354881525453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34384501870099043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619468484576072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34384501870099043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30289593357929884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34384501870099043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28971327261869223,0.34384501870099043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30289593357929884,0.34384501870099043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5297094223360267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5693744211184003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37901396309275603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015666578284909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3425634917832675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2814084778806664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065700862573961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3782467169977228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065700862573961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35815096669886787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35815096669886787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27064043264306636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24670795038203283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636614489630791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636614489630791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636614489630791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24207755368569422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636614489630791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636614489630791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2950182171464827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636614489630791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337099570783525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5526664017525569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4483473763488041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5526664017525569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28787396938342563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3548549165448639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2567296025607502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31259464405831483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2989898750472993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28787396938342563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3548549165448639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3548549165448639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784756050588039,0.0,0.0,0.3548549165448639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3486108120527677,0.0,0.3486108120527677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30709416053627536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25221213249097607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23205883607059255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3486108120527677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3486108120527677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29372878400746844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30709416053627536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3486108120527677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3935370216331532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26697554080422176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23454931545165486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3935370216331532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3935370216331532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661215900560961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3466700317949009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3935370216331532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46610919298669024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6870712688183234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5573825363048931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4816418767972693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5177075453527832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4816418767972693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5177075453527832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41828946917554066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41828946917554066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6165822958312437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5195133419087152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362321781632416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482195692093319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3239611405262235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482195692093319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482195692093319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29339913478064916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3239611405262235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482195692093319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482195692093319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047567402222704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45365742672962045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6687166622797683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5890780633858858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5329655286877902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5728743469097133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41446178858504185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4647409533129201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29313338866532185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22861639771805595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43209516635525463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43209516635525463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43209516635525463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43209516635525463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3390905896566637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.514153005466348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42226666149841763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4917759973868872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4446436695778784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34319954699176564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5672025164625996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5425166833377656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49052131492450113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3786103448447014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가? 그래도 너는 수영을 더 좋아하니까 바 나는 바다를 더 좋아할 거라고 생각하거든. 그거는 잘 몰랐네. 그래도 나중에 우리가 아기가 생긴다면 바다를 더 좋아해야 되지 않을까. 애들을 데리고 뻘 갯벌 같은 데 데리고 가면 애들이 그걸 캐고 놀기에 그게 좋다고 하더라고. 회사 동료분들도 보면 애들 이제 그 뭐지 휴 휴양림이라 해야 되나? 아 캠핑장 이런 거를 빌려 가지고 거기서 캠핑하고 애들 갯벌 같은 데 뛰어놀게 하고 뭐 낚시하고 이렇게 하면서 그런 걸 하더라고. 뭔가 근데 산을 애 산을 애들이랑 같이 가기에는 좀 애들이 크면 괜찮은데 애들이 등산을 할 순 없잖아. 그래서 아 젊을 때는 우리가 등산을 하는 것도 괜찮긴 한데. 우리 둘만 데이트할 때는 근데 애들이 클 때는 아무래도 바다가 나는 더 좋을 거 같아. 아 그러면 처음에 입문하기에는 글램핑이라고 몸만 가면 되는 게 있어. 이 식재료만 사가면 돼. 거기에 세팅이 다 돼 있단 말이야. 거 사람들이 추천하는 게 처음에 사람들이 캠핑을 할 거라고 장비발을 세운다고 하지. 모든 도구들을 사다가 다시 지금 회사분들도 되팔림을 하고 있거든. 중고 매매를 하고 중고 매매를 하고 있는데. 왜냐하면 힘들기도 하고 아 아무래도 힘들고 그 그리고 시간이 많이 나지 않고 캠핑도 유행을 했었어 가지고 막 캠핑장 자리 잡기도 힘들대. 그래 가지고 하고 있는데 우리는 일단 처음에 막 시도를 다 하지는 말고 글램핑을 먼저 한번 시도해 보자. 그래서 근데 글램핑도 요새 아직도 예약을 하기가 빡세긴 하대.그러니까 우리가 가까운 데부터 글램핑을 시도해서 이렇게 하고 이제 추후에는 되면 캠핑을 하는 것으로 한번 해 보자. 아니면 어차피 우리 휴양림도 많이 가니까 휴양림에도 캠핑장이 있거든. 글 글로 가는 것도 괜찮을 거 같은데. 아 그런데 아무래도 여성들이 그래도 캠핑을 꺼리는 이유가 아 과장님이 따 딸들이 안 간다고 하던데 그게 바로 샤워 샤워라고 하더라고 벌레랑. 왜냐하면 벌레가 아무래도 많고 그리고 샤워를 아무래도 공용 시설을 써야 되다 보니까 그 샤워장이 많이 더러워 가지고 여자들이 꺼려 한다는데 자기는 괜찮아? 그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.400393812206746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22770658027271107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2813853497172437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.430375570891748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37912141588516257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37912141588516257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3491396572001606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3377411215646925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42176923929989857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533516043812972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533516043812972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533516043812972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533516043812972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24695435682671119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633637113674115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386651882802227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3640246659756108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067160248304528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3206723525125695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3640246659756108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3640246659756108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386651882802227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21405030204049025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401598,30대,자기가 갔던 여행 중에서 제일 재밌었던 데가 어디야 기억에 남는 나라? 나는 뉴질랜드 갔을 때 제일 기억이 남았던 거는 아무래도 경찰한테 과속하다가 딱지 끊긴 경험이 제일 인상이 남지 않을까 싶어. 나름 나는 그 거기는 고속 도로가 시속 100킬로가 딱 제한이거든. 그래서 내가 속도를 맞춰서 달리고 있었는데 달리고 있는데 그때 기억나? 차들이 한 3대에서 5대 날 추월해서 갔잖아. 반대 차선 넘어서 삑삑거리면서. 그래서 느려 가지고 내가 순간 나도 열이 받아서 속도를 좀 더 가속을 냈는데 갑자기 뒤에서 삐이이 하면서 막 따라왔잖아. 그래서 내가 하 이러면서 한숨 쉬면서 옆에서 막 변명을 했는데 너는 차에서 타서 그냥 구경하고 있었잖아. 아니 그러면 촤 촬영만 하고 있을 게 아니라 그래도 적당한 타이밍에 나와서 도와줬어야지 미인계를 쓰든가. 어 그래서 어쨌든 나는 그게 아무래도 기억에 남는 거 같아. 거 그 나라에는 어쨌든 카메라가 하나도 없더라고. 그래서 아무래도 평소에 달릴 때 조심해야 될 거 같고. 아 그리고 인상적이었던 게 거기는 경찰차가 색깔이 다 달랐어. 흰 색깔 파란 색깔 분홍색이었나 빨간색이었나. 그래서 카메라가 달라서 아 카메라래 차 색깔이 달라서 길가에 옆에 차가 서 있을 때는 항상 지나갈 때마다 긴장을 했던 기억이 인상에 남는 거 같아. 그리고 거의 뭐 내가 하루에 200킬로 300킬로씩 매일 운전을 했었거든. 그래서 나는 마치 여행이라기보다는 운전 훈련을 받는 듯한 느낌이었어. 운전 연습은 항상 시켜 주려고 노력은 하지. 근데 아무래도 네가 좀 많이 무서워하고 우리가 차가 없잖아. 그러면 앞으로 쏘카를 이용해서 하면 되지 않을까? 아무래도 그래도 나는 뉴질랜드 여행이 재밌었거든. 추후에 또 해외여행 가는 거 어때? 그러면 안 그런 나라가 어디 있어? 그러면 아메리카 쪽을 가 보는 거 어때 미국이나 캐나다나? 캐나다가 봄에는 따듯하고 벨기에나 이쪽이 좋대. 그래서 나는 옛날부터 아 벨기에란다. 어쨌든 캐나다에 있는 도시 캐나 캐나다에 한번 나는 가 보고 싶었어. 그 뭐지 빅토리아 폭포 미국하고 경계에 있잖아. 거기도 있고 그리고 아 퀘벡 퀘벡이 그렇게 좋다고 그 옛날에 뭐지 드라마 도깨빈가? 거기서 나온 도시도 있잖아. 그 한번 네가 캐나다는 그리고 인종 차별도 덜 심하고 아무래도 우리나라보다 우리나라만큼 치안이 좋은 나라라서 캐나다를 나는 가 보는 가 보고 싶은데. 캐나다 가는 건 어때? 나는 그래도 아직 젊어서 바다가 좋은 거 같아. 왜냐 아무래도 그냥 바다를 보면 마음이 차분해지고 그리고 뭔가 시원하게 내 마음이 펑 뚫리는 느낌이 있어서 바다 가는 게 더 좋은 거 같고 근데 요새는 산도 좋은 거 같아. 사실 둘 다 좋은 거 같아. 그래서 원래 우리 등산 가기로 했잖아. 가기로 해 놓고 한번도 안 갔네. 등산은 가자. 등산 어 지금 이제 딱 지금 가을이니까 날이 근데 아침에 아직 좀 지금 쌀쌀하긴 하잖아. 그래서 아 쌀쌀하니까 지금이 딱 적기인 거 같아. 쪼금 더 지나면 너 춥다고 못 갈 거 같거든. 그래서 근교에 아차산이나 아니면 광교산 이런 데 가 보는 게 주말에 좋을 거 같아. 지금은 단풍철 아닌가?

그러면 자기는 캠핑은 안 되겠네. 캠핑이 아니라 그냥 자기는 뭐 이렇게 막 찾아서 하는 것도 귀찮아하고 하니까 그냥 해외 동남아 패키지 여행 어르신들 가시는 그런 거를 가야겠는데. 근데 자유여행을 가려면 하나부터 열까지 계획을 다 세워야 되는데 자기는 계획을 안 세우잖아. 이번에 뉴질랜드에 갔을 때도 계획을 하나도 안 세워 가지고 제가 일에서 열까지 책 보면서 계획을 세우고 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 물어봤는데 계획을 세우지 않아서 우리가 싸웠던 경험이 있잖아. 뭐 내가 계획을 세워서 하는 게 문제는 되지는 않겠지만 그래도 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 하고 싶은 게 있을 거고 딱 내가 하는 아 네가 왜냐하면 갔는데 불만족스러울 수도 있잖아. 그러니까 서로 만족을 하기 위해서는 그래도 하고 싶은 게 뭔지 의견을 알려 줘야 계획을 짜는 게 다 쉽지. 그래서 자기는 자유여행보다는 패키지 여행이 딱 맞는 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619009299783415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23629634701948177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4512630843266623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41982621426989325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3660845299430981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4512630843266623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39752139999986713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
